Changes with Apache 2.5.1

  *) mod_http2: Log requests and sent the configured error response in case of
     early detected errors like too many or too long headers.
     [Ruediger Pluem, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: Fix a crash when sending environment variables with no
     value. PR 64598 [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_cgi/mod_cgid: Avoid a second read from a CGI script after a
     timeout, which effectively doubled the configured timeout setting.
     PR 64709.  [Joe Orton]

  *) core: handle headers when replying a 304 following RFC7234.
     [Giovanni Bechis]

  *) mod_http2: remove support for abandoned http-wg draft
     <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kazuho-h2-cache-digest/>.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_proxy_uwsgi: Error out on HTTP header larger than 16K (hard
     protocol limit).  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_dav: Some DAV extensions, like CalDAV, specify both document
     elements and property elements that need to be taken into account
     when generating a property. The document element and property element
     are made available in the dav_liveprop_elem structure under the
     DAV_PROP_ELEMENT key in the resource pool. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dav: Add utility functions dav_validate_root_ns(),
     dav_find_child_ns(), dav_find_next_ns(), dav_find_attr_ns() and
     dav_find_attr() so that other modules get to play too.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_http2: 
     Fixes <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/200>: 
     "LimitRequestFields 0" now disables the limit, as documented.
     Fixes <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/201>: 
     Do not count repeated headers with same name against the field
     count limit. The are merged internally, as if sent in a single HTTP/1 line.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: Avoid segfaults in case of handling certain responses for
     already aborted connections.  [Stefan Eissing, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) core: Remove support for the Content-MD5 header, removed in RFC7231.
     Functions ap_md5digest() and ap_md5contextTo64() removed, and
     ContentDigest directive. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_dav: Allow other DAV modules to use dav_get_resource().
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mpm_common: remove ap_mpm_unregister_poll_callback() and
     mpm_unregister_poll_callback hook. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: add asynchronous handling of Upgrade(d) protocols,
     where idle connections are returned to the MPM and rescheduled on
     another thread when ready. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_dav: Add method_precondition hook. WebDAV extensions define
     conditions that must exist before a WebDAV method can be executed.
     This hook allows a WebDAV extension to verify these preconditions.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add hooks deliver_report and gather_reports to mod_dav.h. Allows other
     modules apart from versioning implementations to handle the REPORT method.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add dav_get_provider(), dav_open_lockdb() and dav_close_lockdb() mod_dav.h.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) "[mod_dav_fs etag handling] should really honor the FileETag setting".
     - It now does.
     - Add "Digest" to FileETag directive, allowing a strong ETag to be
       generated using a file digest.
     - Add ap_make_etag_ex() and ap_set_etag_fd() to allow full control over
       ETag generation.
     - Add concept of "binary notes" to request_rec, allowing packed bit flags
       to be added to a request.
     - First binary note - AP_REQUEST_STRONG_ETAG - allows modules to force
       the ETag to a strong ETag to comply with RFC requirements, such as those
       mandated by various WebDAV extensions.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix a race condition and possible crash when using a proxy client
     certificate (SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile).
     [Armin Abfalterer <a.abfalterer gmail.com>]

  *) mod_proxy: recognize parameters from ProxyPassMatch workers with dollar
     substitution, such that they apply to the backend connection.  Note that
     connection reuse is disabled by default to avoid compatibility issues.
     [Takashi Sato, Jan Kaluza, Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic, Jean-Frederic Clere]

  *) mod_proxy_http: remove proxy-sendchunked and proxy-sendchunks
     handling, the defaut behaviour being now to stream the request body
     using Content-Length when the length is known and fall back to chunked
     Transfer-Encoding otherwise (unless proxy-sendcl is set thus requiring
     that the request body be spooled to memory or filesystem). [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ldap: Avoid performance overhead of APR-util rebind cache for
     OpenLDAP 2.2+.  PR 64414.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_proxy_http: flush spooled request body in one go to avoid
     leaking (or long lived) temporary file. PR 64452. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_fcgi: ProxyFCGISetEnvIf unsets variables when expression
     evaluates to false.  PR64365. [Michael König <mail ikoenig.net>]

  *) mod_proxy_http: handle Upgrade request, 101 (Switching Protocol) response
     and switched protocol forwarding.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: The "ssl_var_lookup" optional function API now takes a
     const char *name argument and returns a const char * string
     value.  The pool argument must now be non-NULL.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: With OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later, SSLRandomSeed is now
     ignored.  OpenSSL must be configured with a suitable entropy
     source, or mod_ssl will fail to start up.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: With OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later, client-initiated
     renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier is blocked at SSL library
     level (with a TLS warning alert sent), rather than by aborting
     the connection inside mod_ssl.  [Joe Orton]
 
  *) core: Add optional "options=" argument to Listen.  Supported
     keywords are "freebind", "reuseport" and "v6only".  PR 61865.
     [Jan Kaluza, Lubos Uhliarik <luhliari redhat.com>, Joe Orton]

  *) config: Allow for environment variable substitution with default value,
     for when the variable is not defined, using format ${VAR?=default value}.
     [Yann Ylavic]

  *) htcacheclean: Empty directories in CacheRoot are still present even after
     using "-t". PR64313 [Petros Marios Prokopiou <pprokopi redhat.com>,
     Ruediger Pluem, Jean-Frederic Clere]

  *) mod_reqtimeout: Cannot override default Virtualhost's mod_reqtimeout.
     PR64295 [Jean-Frederic Clere]

  *) mod_proxy: Allow ProxyErrorOverride to be restricted to specific status 
     codes.  PR63628. [Martin Drößler <mail martindroessler.de>]

  *) configtest: Issue a warning for non-existent directories in <Directory> config
     sections. PR63079. [Stephane Blondon <stephane.blondon gmail.com>].

  *) mod_proxy_http: Fix random memory-corruption in case of an error while
     reading a response from the backend.
     PR 64234 [Ruediger Pluem, Barnim Dzwillo <dzwillo@strato.de>]

  *) core: Use a temporary file when writing the pid file, avoiding
     startup failure if an empty pidfile is left over from a
     previous crashed or aborted invocation of httpd.  PR 63140.
     [Nicolas Carrier <carrier.nicolas0 gmail.com>, Joe Orton]

  *) mod_http2: Fixes issue where mod_unique_id would generate non-unique request
     identifier under load, see <https://github.com/icing/mod_h2/issues/195>.
     [Michael Kaufmann, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_session_cookie: Add SessionCookieMaxAge to allow the mod_session
     cookie to be sent as a "session cookie" with no expiration even when the
     SessionMaxAge will be enforced on the server. PR56040 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_session: Fix an issue that blocked new sessions being created after
     session expiration or other session errors. PR56052 [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy_hcheck: Allow healthcheck expressions to use %{Content-Type}.
     PR64140. [Renier Velazco <renier.velazco upr.edu>]

  *) mod_ssl: Fix memory leak of OCSP stapling response. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_authz_groupfile: Drop AH01666 from loglevel "error" to "info".
     PR64172.

  *) mod_usertrack: Add CookieSameSite, CookieHTTPOnly, and CookieSecure 
     to allow customization of the usertrack cookie. PR64077.
     [Prashant Keshvani <prashant2400 gmail.com>, Eric Covener]
    
  *) mpm_event: avoid possible KeepAlveTimeout off by -100 ms.
     [Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_md:
     - Prefer MDContactEmail directive to ServerAdmin for registration. New directive
       thanks to Timothe Litt (@tlhackque).
     - protocol check for pre-configured "tls-alpn-01" challenge has been improved. It will now
       check all matching virtual hosts for protocol support. Thanks to @mkauf.
     - Corrected a check when OCSP stapling was configured for hosts
       where the responsible MDomain is not clear, by Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm).
     - Softening the restrictions where mod_md configuration directives may appear. This should
       allow for use in <If> and <Macro> sections. If all possible variations lead to the configuration
       you wanted in the first place, is another matter.
     [Michael Kaufmann <mail michael-kaufmann.ch>, Timothe Litt (@tlhackque),
      Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm), Stefan Eissing (@icing)] 

  *) core: ap_method_mask_t type added for method bitmasks, changed
     from apr_int64_t and used for the method_mask field in
     ap_method_list_t, AP_METHOD_BIT, allowed field of request_rec,
     limited field of cmd_parms.  PR 63885.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_ssl: Do not keep connections to OCSP responders alive when doing
     OCSP requests.  PR 64135.  [Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_ssl: Disable client verification on ACME ALPN challenges. Fixes github
     issue mod_md#172 (https://github.com/icing/mod_md/issues/172).
     [Michael Kaufmann <mail michael-kaufmann.ch>, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_rewrite: Extend the [CO] (cookie) flag of RewriteRule to accept a 
     SameSite attribute. [Eric Covener]

  *) Update DOCTYPE tags in server-generated HTML. PR62989.
     [Andra Farkas <deepbluemistake gmail.com>, Giovanni Bechis <giovanni paclan.it>]

  *) mod_setenvif: Passing an env-variable parameter of "--early" in non-perdir
     context runs directives from this module before `RequestHeader ... early` 
     are evaluated. This allows results of SetEnvIf conditionals to be used 
     to modify request headers in early mode. [Eric Covener]

  *) config: Speed up graceful restarts by using pre-hashed command table. PR 64066.
     [Giovanni Bechis <giovanni paclan.it>, Jim Jagielski]

  *) mod_lua: Add r:headers_in_table, r:headers_out_table, r:err_headers_out_table,
     r:notes_table, r:subprocess_env_table as read-only native table alternatives
     that can be iterated over. [Eric Covener]

  *) configure: Add manualdir and proxycachedir to the APR_ENABLE_LAYOUT macro call.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add support for cross compiling to apxs. If apxs is being executed from somewhere
     other than its target location, add that prefix to includes and library directories.
     Without this, apxs would fail to find config_vars.mk and exit. [Graham Leggett]

  *) Add a config layout for OpenWRT. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_http2: Fixed rare cases where a h2 worker could deadlock the main connection. 
     [Yann Ylavic, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_lua: Accept nil assignments to the exposed tables (r.subprocess_env, 
     r.headers_out, etc) to remove the key from the table. PR63971. 
     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_http2: Fixed interaction with mod_reqtimeout. A loaded mod_http2 was disabling the
     ssl handshake timeouts. Also, fixed a mistake of the last version that made `H2Direct` 
     always `on`, regardless of configuration. Found and reported by
     <Armin.Abfalterer@united-security-providers.ch> and
     <Marcial.Rion@united-security-providers.ch>. [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_http2: Multiple field length violations in the same request no longer cause
     several log entries to be written. [@mkauf]
  
  *) mod_md: v2.2.4 from github, Fixes a compile time issue with OpenSSL 1.0.2 in 
     the new OCSP code. Skips port checks for domain server_rec selection when "tls-alpn-01" 
     is configured explicitly (related to #133). [@mkauf, Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_ssl: Support logging private key material for use with
     wireshark via log file given by SSLKEYLOGFILE environment
     variable.  Requires OpenSSL 1.1.1.  PR 63391.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_proxy: Improve tunneling loop to support half closed connections and
     pending data draining (for protocols like rsync). PR 61616. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy: Add proxy check_trans hook for proxy modules to possibly
     decline request handling at early stage.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy: Put mod_proxy_{connect,wstunnel} tunneling code in common in
     proxy_util.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Fix the forwarding of requests with content body when a
     balancer member is unavailable; the retry on the next member was issued
     with an empty body (regression introduced in 2.4.41).  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: negotiate the TLS protocol version per name based vhost
     configuration, when linked with OpenSSL-1.1.1 or later. The base vhost's
     SSLProtocol (from the first vhost declared on the IP:port) is now only
     relevant if no SSLProtocol is declared for the vhost or globally,
     otherwise the vhost or global value apply.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Fix 100-continue deadlock for spooled request bodies,
     leading to Request Timeout (408).  PR 63855.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_deflate, mod_brotli: honor "Accept-Encoding: foo;q=0" as per RFC 7231; which
     means 'foo' is "not acceptable".  PR 58158 [Chistophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_proxy: Fix crash by resolving pool concurrency problems. PR 63503
     [Ruediger Pluem, Eric Covener]

  *) core: On Windows, fix a start-up crash if <IfFile ...> is used with a path that is not
     valid (For example, testing for a file on a flash drive that is not mounted)
     [Christophe Jaillet]

  *) mod_proxy_balancer: Fix case-sensitive referer check related to CSRF/XSS 
     protection. PR63688. [Armin Abfalterer <a.abfalterer gmail.com>]

  *) mod_authn_socache: Increase the maximum length of strings that can be cached by
     the module from 100 to 256.  PR 62149 [<thorsten.meinl knime.com>]

  *) mod_ssl: reverting a 2.4.40 change where a superfluous SSLCertificateChainFile configuration
     for a domain managed by mod_md caused a startup error. This happened when mod_md installed 
     its fallback certificate, before it got the first real certificate from Lets Encrypt.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core, mod_rewrite: Set PCRE_DOTALL by default. Revert via 
     RegexDefaultOptions -DOTALL [Yann Ylavic]

  *) core: Remove request details from built-in error documents [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_http2: core setting "LimitRequestFieldSize" is not additionally checked on
     merged header fields, just as HTTP/1.1 does. [Stefan Eissing, Michael Kaufmann]

  *) mod_http2: fixed a bug that prevented proper stream cleanup when connection
     throttling was in place. Stream resets by clients on streams initiated by them
     are counted as possible trigger for throttling. [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_http2/mpm_event: Fixes the behaviour when a HTTP/2 connection has nothing
     more to write with streams ongoing (flow control block). The timeout waiting
     for the client to send WINODW_UPDATE was incorrectly KeepAliveTimeout and not
     Timeout as it should be. Fixes PR 63534. [Yann Ylavic, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl/mod_md: reversing dependency by letting mod_ssl offer hooks for
     adding certificates and keys to a virtual host. An additional hook allows
     answering special TLS connections as used in ACME challenges.
     Adding 2 new hooks for init/get of OCSP stapling status information when
     other modules want to provide those. Falls back to own implementation with
     same behaviour as before.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_ssl: use OPENSSL_init_ssl() to initialise OpenSSL on versions 1.1+.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_proxy_http2: adding support for handling trailers in both directions. PR 63502.
     [Stefan Eissing]

     [Eric Covener]

  *) mod_proxy/ssl: Cleanup per-request SSL configuration anytime a backend
     connection is recycled/reused to avoid a possible crash with some SSLProxy
     configurations in <Location> or <Proxy> context. PR 63256. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_mime: Add `MimeOptions` directive to allow Content-Type or all metadata
     detection to use only the last (right-most) file extension or to be
     disabled per-dir. [Eric Covener]

  *) MPMs unix: bind the bucket number of each child to its slot number, for a
     more efficient per bucket maintenance. [Yann Ylavic]

  *) http: LimitRequestBody applies to proxied requests.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_logio: Add LogIOTrackTTFU and %^FU logformat to log the time
     difference between request start and last request body byte read (finished upload).
     [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_ssl: add support for TLSv1.3 (tested with OpenSSL v1.1.1-pre4, other libs may
     need more sugar). SSL(Proxy)CipherSuite now has an optional first parameter for the
     protocol the ciphers are for.
     Directive "SSLVerifyClient" now triggers certificate retrieval from the client (this
     is not fully tested - but fails in similar fashion as in TLSv1.2 in my setups).
     Verifying the client fails exactly the same for HTTP/2 connections for all SSL protocols,
     as this would need to trigger the master connection thread - which we do not support
     right now.
     Renegotiation of ciphers is intentionally ignored for TLSv1.3 connections. "SSLCipherSuite"
     does not allow to specify TLSv1.3 ciphers in a directory context (because it cannot work) and
     TLSv1.2 or lower ciphers are not relevant, as cipher suites are completely separate.
     This means there is a bit if a world split when simultaneously having TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3
     connections to the same server.
     [Yann Ylavic, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: heavily simplified SSLPolicy. No more user defines, no propxy policies,
     just the basic "modern", "intermediate" and "old" as specified by Mozilla security.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: fixes error in renew window calculation that may lead to mod_md running
     watchdog in a tight loop until actual renewal becomes necessary. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: /.well-known/acme-challenge requests that cannot be answered for hostnames
     outside the configured MDs are free to be answered by other handlers. This allows
     co-existance between mod_md and other ACME clients on the same server (implements PR62189).

  *) mod_md v1.1.8: new configuration directive "MDBaseServer on|off" to allow/inhibit 
     management of the base server domains outside VirtualHosts. By default, this is "off", 
     e.g. mod_md will not manage certificates or perform https: redirections on the 
     base server. [Stefan Eissing]
              
  *) core: Add "AcceptErrorsNonFatal" to allow ECONNREFUSED, ECONNABORTED, and
     ECONNRESET during the client accept() to not trigger graceful shutdown of

  *) mod_md v1.1.7:
     - MDMustStaple was unable to create the necessary OpenSSL OBJ identifier on some platforms, 
       possibly because this fails if the OID is already configured in ```openssl.cnf```, see
       [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/2795).
     - Two memory leaks in cert issuer and alt-names lookup eliminated by Yann Ylavic.
     - Changing MDMustStaple triggers certificate renewal.
     - More verbosity when *not* handing out certificates, e.g. mod_ssl asks, but mod_md has no
       idea what it is talking about. Some people report misbehaviour here.
     - Re-enabled support for md_get_credentials() function that was used in older mod_ssl
       patch, so that people with old patched servers get a chance to upgrade.

     Add higher level WARNING log when initial request to ACME server fails, mentioning
     some advice. [Stefan Eissing] 
     
  *) mod_md: name change in configuration directives. The old names are still working
     in this version, so you can safely upgrade. They will give warnings in the log and
     will disappear in the immediate future. ManagedDomain is now MDomain,
     <ManagedDomain> is now <MDomainSet>. [Stefan Eissing]

     only necessary work for mod_ssl to be also happy with the configuration.
     [Stefan Eissing] 

  *) mod_md: v1.0.4, removed the 'a2md' utility command from build. Only used in github

  *) mod_ssl: Fail with 403 if the username for FakeBasicAuth mode
     includes a colon character.  PR 52644.  [Joe Orton]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.3, fixed various bugs in persisting job properties, so that status is 
     persisted across child process changes and staging is reset on reloads. Changed 
     MDCertificateAgreement url checks. As long as the CA reports that the account has 
     an agreement, no further checking is done. Existing accounts need no changes when
     a new agreement comes out. [Stefan Eissing]

Changes with Apache 2.5.0-alpha

  *) mod_md: v1.0.1, ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer
     auto-added to a Managed Domain. Error counts of jobs are persisted. When the server
     restarts (gracefully) any errored staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal
     process. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v1.0.0, new config directive 'MDNotifyCmd' to hook in a program when Managed
     Domains have obtained/renewed their certificates successfully. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.9, fix for applying challenge type based on available ports. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.7
     - Use of the new module flag
     - Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. 
     - Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
     - MDRequireHttps now happens before any Redirect.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: unshare SSLSrvConfigRec instances between base server and virtual hosts. This avoids
     overwrites of later initializattions (vhost_id), selective disables by "SSLEngine addr-list"
     and certificate/key pickup from mod_md. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.6: a "MDRequireHttps permanent" configured domain automatically sends out
     HSTS (rfc 6797) headers in https: responses. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: adding ssl_policies.h[.in] for policy cipher/protocol definitions. Use 
     update_policies.py to update manually from Mozilla JSON definitions at
     https://statics.tls.security.mozilla.org/server-side-tls-conf.json
     [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_md: v0.9.5:
     - New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
       new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
     - Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
       after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
       to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messages might appear a
       second time in the logs.
     - Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
       is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
       VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
       its address list.
     - New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
       or temporarily.
     - Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
       a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.
     - compatibility with libressl
       [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.2: new directive 'MDHttpProxy' to define a proxy for outgoing connection,
     some minor bugfixes, twiddle the build system to avoid non-pic code generation.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_md: v0.9.1:
     - various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
       someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
       reload and change back to the wanted ones.
     - various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
     - mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
       to facilitate upgrades.
    [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: v0.9.0:
     Certificate provisioning from Let's Encrypt (and other ACME CAs) for mod_ssl virtual hosts.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: add SSLPolicy (define/use) and SSLProxyPolicy directives plus documentation. Add
     core definitions for policies 'modern', 'intermediate' and 'old', as defined by Mozilla
     in <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS>. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_md: new module for managing domains across VirtualHosts with ACME protocol 
     implementation for automated certificate signup and renewal. Default CA is
     the test area of Let's Encrypt right now, so certificates root will not be valid.
     Will be switched to the real service endpoint rather soon. If you need it now,
     configure 'MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'.

     treated as alias for http_proxy by some programs. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Don't establish or reuse a backend connection before pre-
     fetching the request body, so to minimize the delay between it is supposed

     Also, handle a new "proxy-flushall" environment variable which allows to
     flush any forwarded body data immediately. PR 56541+37920. [Yann Ylavic]
