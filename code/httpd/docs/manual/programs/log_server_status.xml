<title>log_server_status - Log periodic status summaries</title>

<summary>
    <p>This perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by
    something like cron. It connects to the server and downloads the status
    information. It reformats the information to a single line and logs it to
    a file. Adjust the variables at the top of the script to specify the
    location of the resulting logfile. <module>mod_status</module> will
    need to be loaded and configured in order for this script to do its
    job.</p>
</summary>

<section id="configure"><title>Usage</title>

<p>The script contains the following section.</p>

<highlight language="perl">
my $wherelog = "/usr/local/apache2/logs/";  # Logs will be like "/usr/local/apache2/logs/19960312"
my $server   = "localhost";        # Name of server, could be "www.foo.com"
my $port     = "80";               # Port on server
my $request = "/server-status/?auto";    # Request to send
</highlight>

<p>You'll need to ensure that these variables have the correct values,
and you'll need to have the <code>/server-status</code> handler
configured at the location specified, and the specified log location
needs to be writable by the user which will run the script.</p>

<p>Run the script periodically via cron to produce a daily log file,
which can then be used for statistical analysis.</p>
