<title>split-logfile - Split up multi-vhost logfiles</title>

<summary>
    <p>This perl script will take a combined Web server access log file and
    break its contents into separate files. It assumes that the first field of
    each line is the virtual host identity, put there using the "<code>%v</code>"
    variable in <directive module="mod_log_config">LogFormat</directive>.
    </p>
</summary>

<section id="split-logfile"><title>Usage</title>

    <p>Create a log file with virtual host information in it:</p>

    <highlight language="config">
LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" combined_plus_vhost
CustomLog "logs/access_log" combined_plus_vhost
    </highlight>

    <p>Log files will be created, in the directory where you run the
    script, for each virtual host name that appears in the combined log file.
    These logfiles will named after the hostname, with a
    <code>.log</code> file extension.</p>

    <p>The combined log file is read from stdin. Records read will be appended
    to any existing log files.</p>

    <example>split-logfile &lt; access_log</example>
