  <title>logresolve - Resolve IP-addresses to hostnames in Apache
   log files</title>

<summary>
     <p><code>logresolve</code> is a post-processing program to
     resolve IP-addresses in Apache's access logfiles.  To minimize
     impact on your nameserver, logresolve has its very own internal
     hash-table cache.  This means that each IP number will only be
     looked up the first time it is found in the log file.</p>

     <p>Takes an Apache log file on standard input.  The IP addresses
     must be the first thing on each line and must be separated from
     the remainder of the line by a space.</p>

<dt><code>-s <var>filename</var></code></dt>

<dd>Specifies a filename to record statistics.</dd>

<dt><code>-c</code></dt>

<dd>This causes <code>logresolve</code> to apply some DNS checks:
after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP
addresses for the hostname and checks that one of these matches the
original address.</dd>
