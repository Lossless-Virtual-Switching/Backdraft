<title>suexec - Switch user before executing external programs</title>

<summary>
     <p><code>suexec</code> is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch
     to another user before executing CGI programs. In order to achieve this,
     it must run as <code>root</code>. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't
     run as <code>root</code>, the <code>suexec</code> executable needs the
     setuid bit set and must be owned by <code>root</code>. It should never be
     writable for any other person than <code>root</code>.</p>

     <p>For further information about the concepts and the security model
     of suexec please refer to the suexec documentation (<a
     href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/&httpd.docs;/suexec.html"
     >http://httpd.apache.org/docs/&httpd.docs;/suexec.html</a>).</p>
