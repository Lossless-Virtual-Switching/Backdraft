      information and communicate between programs.  Apache also contains
      internal variables that are referred to as environment variables, but are
      stored in internal Apache structures, rather than in the shell
      environment.<br />
      See: <a href="env.html">Environment Variables in Apache</a>

    </dd>

    <dt><a name="filter" id="filter">Filter</a></dt>
    <dd>A process that is applied to data that is sent or received by the
      server.  Input filters process data sent by the client to the server,
      while output filters process documents on the server before they are sent
      to the client.  For example, the <code>INCLUDES</code> output filter
      processes documents for <glossary ref="ssi">Server Side
      Includes</glossary>.<br />

      <a name="fqdn" id="fqdn">(FQDN)</a></dt>
    <dd>The unique name of a network entity, consisting of a hostname and a
      domain name that can resolve to an IP address. For example,
      <code>www</code> is a hostname, <code>example.com</code> is a domain name,
      and <code>www.example.com</code> is a fully-qualified domain name.
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="handler" id="handler">Handler</a></dt>
    <dd>An internal Apache representation of the action to be performed when a
      file is called. Generally, files have implicit handlers, based on the file
      type. Normally, all files are simply served by the server, but certain
      file types are "handled" separately.  For example, the
      <code>cgi-script</code> handler designates files to be processed as
      <glossary ref="cgi">CGIs</glossary>.<br />

    <dt><a name="hash" id="hash">Hash</a></dt>
    <dd>A mathematical one-way, irreversible algorithm generating a string with
      fixed-length from another string of any length. Different input strings
      will usually produce different hashes (depending on the hash function).

      is placed inside the web tree and applies configuration <glossary
      ref="directive">directives</glossary> to the directory where it is
      placed and all sub-directories.  Despite its name, this file can hold
      almost any type of directive, not just access-control directives.<br />
      See: <a href="configuring.html">Configuration Files</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="httpd.conf" id="httpd.conf">httpd.conf</a></dt>
    <dd>The main Apache <glossary ref="configurationfile">configuration
      file</glossary>.  The default location is

    <dt><a name="method" id="method">Method</a></dt>
    <dd>In the context of <glossary ref="http">HTTP</glossary>, an action to
      perform on a resource, specified on the request line by the client.  Some
      of the methods available in HTTP are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,

      See: <a href="mod/mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="module" id="module">Module</a></dt>
    <dd>An independent part of a program.  Much of Apache's functionality is
      contained in modules that you can choose to include or exclude.  Modules
      that are compiled into the Apache <program>httpd</program> binary are
      called <dfn>static modules</dfn>, while modules that are stored
      separately and can be optionally loaded at run-time are called
      <dfn>dynamic modules</dfn> or <glossary ref="dso">DSOs</glossary>.
      Modules that are included by default
      are called <dfn>base modules</dfn>. Many modules are available for Apache
      that are not distributed as part of the Apache HTTP Server <glossary
      ref="tarball">tarball</glossary>.  These are referred to as
      <dfn>third-party modules</dfn>.<br />
      See: <a href="mod/">Module Index</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="modulemagicnumber" id="modulemagicnumber">Module Magic
      Number</a> (<a name="mmn" id="mmn">MMN</a>)</dt>
    <dd>Module Magic Number is a constant defined in the Apache source code that
      is associated with binary compatibility of modules. It is changed when
      internal Apache structures, function calls and other significant parts of
      API change in such a way that binary compatibility cannot be guaranteed
      any more. On MMN change, all third party modules have to be at least
      recompiled, sometimes even slightly changed in order to work with the new
      version of Apache.

      Cryptography</glossary> system, used to decrypt incoming messages and
      sign outgoing ones.<br />
      See: <a href="ssl/">SSL/TLS Encryption</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="proxy" id="proxy">Proxy</a></dt>
    <dd>An intermediate server that sits between the client and the <em>origin
        server</em>.  It accepts requests from clients, transmits those requests
      on to the origin server, and then returns the response from the origin
      server to the client.  If several clients request the same content, the
      proxy can deliver that content from its cache, rather than requesting it
      from the origin server each time, thereby reducing response time.<br />
      See: <a href="mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="publickey" id="publickey">Public Key</a></dt>
    <dd>The publicly available key in a <glossary
      ref="publickeycryptography">Public Key Cryptography</glossary> system,
      used to encrypt messages bound for its owner and to decrypt signatures
      made by its owner.<br />
      See: <a href="ssl/">SSL/TLS Encryption</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="publickeycryptography"
      id="publickeycryptography">Public Key Cryptography</a></dt>
    <dd>The study and application of asymmetric encryption systems, which use
      one key for encryption and another for decryption. A corresponding pair of
      such keys constitutes a key pair. Also called Asymmetric Cryptography.
      <br />
      See: <a href="ssl/">SSL/TLS Encryption</a>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="regularexpression" id="regularexpression">Regular Expression</a>
      <a name="regex" id="regex">(Regex)</a></dt>
    <dd>A way of describing a pattern in text - for example, "all the words that
      begin with the letter A" or "every 10-digit phone number" or even "Every
      sentence with two commas in it, and no capital letter Q". Regular
      expressions are useful in Apache because they let you apply certain
      attributes against collections of files or resources in very flexible ways
      - for example, all .gif and .jpg files under any "images" directory could
      be written as "<code>/images/.*(jpg|gif)$</code>".  In places where
      regular expressions are used to replace strings, the special variables
      $1 ... $9 contain backreferences to the grouped parts (in parentheses) of
      the matched expression. The special variable $0 contains a backreference
      to the whole matched expression. To write a literal dollar sign in a
      replacement string, it can be escaped with a backslash. Historically, the
      variable &amp; could be used as alias for $0 in some places. This is no
      longer possible since version 2.3.6.  Apache uses Perl Compatible Regular
      Expressions provided by the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</a>
      library.  You can find more documentation about PCRE's regular expression
      syntax at that site, or at

    <dt><a name="reverseproxy" id="reverseproxy">Reverse Proxy</a></dt>
    <dd>A <glossary ref="proxy">proxy</glossary> server that appears to the client
      as if it is an <em>origin server</em>.  This is useful to hide the real
      origin server from the client for security reasons, or to load balance.

        Layer</a> <a name="ssl" id="ssl">(SSL)</a></dt>
    <dd>A protocol created by Netscape Communications Corporation for general
      communication authentication and encryption over TCP/IP networks.  The most
      popular usage is <em>HTTPS</em>, i.e. the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
      over SSL.<br />

    <dd>An SSL function that allows passing the desired server
      hostname in the initial SSL handshake message, so that the web
      server can select the correct virtual host configuration to use
