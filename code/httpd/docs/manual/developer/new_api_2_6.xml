<title>API Changes in Apache HTTP Server 2.6 since 2.4</title>

<summary>
  <p>This document describes changes to the Apache HTTPD API from
     version 2.4 to 2.6, that may be of interest to module/application
     developers and core hacks.  As of the first GA release of the
     2.6 branch API compatibility is preserved for the life of the
     2.6 branch.  (The
     <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.6.x/VERSIONING">VERSIONING</a>
     description for the 2.6 release provides more information about API
     compatibility.)</p>

  <p>API changes fall into two categories: APIs that are altogether new,
     and existing APIs that are expanded or changed.  The latter are
     further divided into those where all changes are backwards-compatible
     (so existing modules can ignore them), and those that might
     require attention by maintainers.  As with the transition from
     HTTPD 2.2 to 2.4, existing modules and applications will require
     recompiling and may call for some attention, but most should not
     require any substantial updating (although some may be able to
     take advantage of API changes to offer significant improvements).</p>
  <p>For the purpose of this document, the API is split according
     to the public header files.  These headers are themselves the
     reference documentation, and can be used to generate a browsable
     HTML reference with <code>make docs</code>.</p>
