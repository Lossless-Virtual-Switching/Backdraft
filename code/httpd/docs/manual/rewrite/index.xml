  <title>Apache mod_rewrite</title>

<summary>

    <p><module>mod_rewrite</module> provides a way to modify incoming
    URL requests, dynamically, based on <a href="intro.html#regex">regular
    expression</a> rules. This allows you to map arbitrary URLs onto
    your internal URL structure in any way you like.</p>

      <p>It supports an unlimited number of rules and an
      unlimited number of attached rule conditions for each rule to
      provide a really flexible and powerful URL manipulation
      mechanism. The URL manipulations can depend on various tests:
      server variables, environment variables, HTTP
      headers, time stamps, external database lookups, and various other
      external programs or handlers, can be used to achieve granular URL
      matching.</p>

      <p>Rewrite rules can operate on the full URLs, including the path-info
      and query string portions, and may be used in per-server context
      (<code>httpd.conf</code>), per-virtualhost context (<directive
      type="section" module="core">VirtualHost</directive> blocks), or
      per-directory context (<code>.htaccess</code> files and <directive
      type="section" module="core">Directory</directive> blocks). The
      rewritten result can lead to further rules, internal
      sub-processing, external request redirection, or proxy
      passthrough, depending on what <a href="flags.html">flags</a> you
      attach to the rules.</p>

      <p>Since mod_rewrite is so powerful, it can indeed be rather
      complex. This document supplements the <a
      href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>, and
      attempts to allay some of that complexity, and provide highly
      annotated examples of common scenarios that you may handle with
      mod_rewrite. But we also attempt to show you when you should not
      use mod_rewrite, and use other standard Apache features instead,
      thus avoiding this unnecessary complexity.</p>
