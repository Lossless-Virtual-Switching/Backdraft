  <title>Directive Quick Reference</title>
  <summary>
    <p>The directive quick reference shows the usage, default, status,
    and context of each Apache configuration directive.  For more
    information about each of these, see the <a
    href="directive-dict.html">Directive Dictionary</a>.</p>

    <p>The first column gives the directive name and usage.  The second
    column shows the default value of the directive, if a default exists.
    If the default is too large to display, it will be truncated
    and followed by "+".</p>

    <p>The third and fourth columns list the contexts where the directive
    is allowed and the status of the directive according to the legend
    tables below.</p>
