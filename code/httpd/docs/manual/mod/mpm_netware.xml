<description>Multi-Processing Module implementing an exclusively threaded web
    server optimized for Novell NetWare</description>

<summary>
    <p>This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) implements an exclusively
    threaded web server that has been optimized for Novell
    NetWare.</p>

    <p>The main thread is responsible for launching child
    worker threads which listen for connections and serve them when they
    arrive. Apache HTTP Server always tries to maintain several <dfn>spare</dfn>
    or idle worker threads, which stand ready to serve incoming
    requests. In this way, clients do not need to wait for a new
    child threads to be spawned before their requests can be
    served.</p>

    <p>The <directive module="mpm_common">StartThreads</directive>,
    <directive module="mpm_common">MinSpareThreads</directive>,
    <directive module="mpm_common">MaxSpareThreads</directive>, and
    <directive module="mpm_netware">MaxThreads</directive>
    regulate how the main thread creates worker threads to serve
    requests. In general, Apache httpd is very self-regulating, so most
    sites do not need to adjust these directives from their default
    values. Sites with limited memory may need to decrease <directive
    module="mpm_netware">MaxThreads</directive> to keep the server from
    thrashing (spawning and terminating idle threads). More information
    about tuning process creation is provided in the <a
    href="../misc/perf-tuning.html">performance hints</a>
    documentation.</p>

    <p><directive module="mpm_common">MaxConnectionsPerChild</directive>
    controls how frequently the server recycles processes by killing old
    ones and launching new ones. On the NetWare OS it is highly
    recommended that this directive remain set to 0. This allows worker
    threads to continue servicing requests indefinitely.</p>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>MaxThreads</directive> directive sets the desired
    maximum number worker threads allowable. The default value is
    also the compiled in hard limit. Therefore it can only be lowered,
    for example:</p>

    <example>
      MaxThreads 512
    </example>
