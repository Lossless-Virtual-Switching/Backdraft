<summary>
<p>It is a module that sends static content at a bandwidth rate limit, defined
by the various old modem standards. So, you can browse your site with a 56k
V.92 modem, by adding something like this:</p>

<highlight language="config">
&lt;Location "/mysite"&gt;
    ModemStandard "V.92"
&lt;/Location&gt;
</highlight>

<p>Previously to do bandwidth rate limiting modules would have to block an entire
thread, for each client, and insert sleeps to slow the bandwidth down.
Using the new suspend feature, a handler can get callback N milliseconds in
the future, and it will be invoked by the Event MPM on a different thread,
once the timer hits.  From there the handler can continue to send data to the client.</p>
