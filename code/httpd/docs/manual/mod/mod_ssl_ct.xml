<description>Implementation of Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962)
</description>
<status>Extension</status>
<sourcefile>mod_ssl_ct.c</sourcefile>
<identifier>ssl_ct_module</identifier>

<summary>

<p>This module provides an implementation of Certificate Transparency, in
conjunction with <module>mod_ssl</module> and command-line tools from the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/">certificate-transparency</a>
open source project.  The goal of Certificate Transparency is to expose the
use of server certificates which are trusted by browsers but were mistakenly
or maliciously issued.  More information about Certificate Transparency is
available at <a href="http://www.certificate-transparency.org/">
http://www.certificate-transparency.org/</a>.  Key terminology used in
this documentation:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Certificate log</dt>
  <dd>A certificate log, referred to simply as <q>log</q> in this documentation,
  is a network service to which server certificates have been submitted.  A
  user agent can confirm that the certificate of a server which it accesses
  has been submitted to a log which it trusts, and that the log itself has
  not been tampered with.</dd>

  <dt>Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT)</dt>
  <dd>This is an acknowledgement from a log that it has accepted a valid
  certificate.  It is signed with the log's public key.  One or more SCTs
  is passed to clients during the handshake, either in the ServerHello
  (TLS extension), certificate extension, or in a stapled OCSP response.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This implementation for Apache httpd provides these features for TLS
servers and proxies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) can be obtained from logs
  automatically and, in conjunction with any statically configured SCTs, sent
  to aware clients in the ServerHello (during the handshake).</li>
  <li>SCTs can be received by the proxy from origin servers in the ServerHello,
  in a certificate extension, and/or within stapled OCSP responses; any SCTs
  received can be partially validated on-line and optionally queued for off-line
  audit.</li>
  <li>The proxy can be configured to disallow communication with an origin
  server which does not provide an SCT which passes on-line validation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Configuration information about logs can be defined statically in the web
server configuration or maintained in a SQLite3 database.  In the latter case,
<module>mod_ssl_ct</module> will reload the database periodically, so any
site-specific infrastructure for maintaining and propagating log configuration
information does not have to also restart httpd to make it take effect.</p>

<note>This module is experimental for the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Insufficient test and review</li>
  <li>Reliance on an unreleased version of OpenSSL (1.0.2, Beta 3 or later) for
  basic operation</li>
  <li>Incomplete <a href="#audit">off-line audit capability</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Configuration mechanisms, format of data saved for off-line audit, and
other characteristics are subject to change based on further feedback and
testing.</p>
</note>
</summary>

<section id="server">
  <title>Server processing overview</title>

  <p>Servers need to send SCTs to their clients.  SCTs in a certificate
  extension or stapled OCSP response will be sent without any special program
  logic.  This module handles sending SCTs configured by the administrator or
  received from configured logs.</p>

  <p>The number of SCTs sent in the ServerHello (i.e., not including those in a
  certificate extension or stapled OCSP response) can be limited by the
  <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">CTServerHelloSCTLimit</directive>
  directive.</p>

  <p>For each server certificate, a daemon process maintains an SCT list to be
  sent in the ServerHello, created from statically configured SCTs as well as
  those received from logs.  Logs marked as untrusted or with a maximum valid
  timestamp before the present time will be ignored.  Periodically the daemon
  will submit certificates to a log as necessary (due to changed log
  configuration or age) and rebuild the concatenation of SCTs.</p>

  <p>The SCT list for a server certificate will be sent to any client that
  indicates awareness in the ClientHello when that particular server certificate
  is used.</p>

</section>

<section id="proxy">
  <title>Proxy processing overview</title>

  <p>The proxy indicates Certificate Transparency awareness in the ClientHello
  by including the <em>signed_certificate_timestamp</em> extension.  It can
  recognize SCTs received in the ServerHello, in an extension in the certificate
  for an origin server, or in a stapled OCSP response.</p>

  <p>On-line verification is attempted for each received SCT:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For any SCT, the timestamp can be checked to see if it is not yet valid
    based on the current time as well as any configured valid time interval for
    the log.</li>
    <li>For an SCT from a log for which a public key is configured, the server
    signature will be checked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If verification fails for at least one SCT and verification was not
  successful for at least one SCT, the connection is aborted if
  <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">CTProxyAwareness</directive> is set to
  <em>require</em>.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the server certificate chain and SCTs are stored for off-line
  verification if the <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">CTAuditStorage</directive>
  directive is configured.</p>

  <p>As an optimization, on-line verification and storing of data from the
  server is only performed the first time a web server child process receives
  the data.  This saves some processing time as well as disk space.  For typical
  reverse proxy setups, very little processing overhead will be required.</p>

</section>

<section id="logconf">
  <title>Log configuration</title>

  <p>Servers and proxies use different information about logs for their processing.
  This <em>log configuration</em> can be set in two ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a log configuration database using <program>ctlogconfig</program>,
    and configure the path to that database using the <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">
    CTLogConfig</directive> directive.  This method of configuration supports
    dynamic updates; <module>mod_ssl_ct</module> will re-read the database at
    intervals.  Additionally, the off-line audit program <code>ctauditscts</code>
    can use this configuration to find the URL of logs.</li>

    <li>Configure information about logs statically using the <directive
    module="mod_ssl_ct">CTStaticLogConfig</directive> directive.  As with all other
    directives, the server must be restarted in order to pick up changes to the
    directives.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The information that can be configured about a log using either mechanism is
  described below:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>log id</dt>
    <dd>The log id is the SHA-256 hash of the log's public key, and is part of
    every SCT.  This is a convenient way to identify a particular log when
    configuring valid timestamp ranges or certain other information.</dd>

    <dt>public key of the log</dt>
    <dd>A proxy must have the public key of the log in order to check the
    signature in SCTs it receives which were obtained from the log.
    <br />
    A server must have the public key of the log in order to submit certificates
    to it.</dd>

    <dt>general trust/distrust setting</dt>
    <dd>This is a mechanism to distrust or restore trust in a particular log,
    for whatever reason (including simply avoiding interaction with the
    log in situations where it is off-line).</dd>

    <dt>minimum and/or maximum valid timestamps</dt>
    <dd>When configured, the proxy will check that timestamps from SCTs
    are within the valid range.</dd>

    <dt>log URL</dt>
    <dd>The URL of the log (for its API) is required by a server in order to
    submit server certificates to the log.  The server will submit
    each server certificate in order to obtain an SCT for each log with a
    configured URL, except when the log is also marked as distrusted or the
    current time is not within any configured valid timestamp range.
    <br />
    The log URL is also needed by off-line auditing of SCTs received by a
    proxy.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Generally, only a small subset of this information is configured for a
  particular log.  Refer to the documentation for the <directive
  module="mod_ssl_ct">CTStaticLogConfig</directive> directive and the
  <program>ctlogconfig</program> command for more specific information.</p>

</section>

<section id="static">
  <title>Storing SCTs in a form consumable by mod_ssl_ct</title>

  <p><module>mod_ssl_ct</module> allows you to configure SCTs statically
  using the <directive>CTStaticSCTs</directive> directive.  These must be
  in binary form, ready to send to a client.</p>

  <p>Sample code in the form of a Python script to build an SCT in the correct
  format from data received from a log can be found in
  <a href="https://github.com/tomrittervg/ct-tools">Tom Ritter's ct-tools
  repository</a>.  Refer to <code>write-sct.py</code></p>
</section>

<section id="logging">
  <title>Logging CT status in the access log</title>

  <p>Proxy and server modes set the <code>SSL_CT_PROXY_STATUS</code> and
  <code>SSL_CT_CLIENT_STATUS</code> variables, respectively, to indicate
  if the corresponding peer is CT-aware.</p>

  <p>Proxy mode sets the <code>SSL_CT_PROXY_SCT_SOURCES</code> variable to
  indicate whether and where SCTs were obtained (ServerHello, certificate
  extension, etc.).</p>

  <p>These variables can be logged with the <code>%{<em>varname</em>}e</code>
  format of <module>mod_log_config</module>.</p>
</section>

<section id="audit">
  <title>Off-line audit for proxy</title>

  <p>Experimental support for this is implemented in the <code>ctauditscts</code>
  command, which itself relies on the <code>verify_single_proof.py</code> tool in the
  <em>certificate-transparency</em> open source project.  <code>ctauditscts</code>
  can parse data for off-line audit (enabled with the <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">
  CTAuditStorage</directive> directive) and invoke <code>verify_single_proof.py</code>.
  </p>

  <p>Here are rough notes for using <code>ctauditscts</code>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a <em>virtualenv</em> using the <code>requirements.txt</code> file
    from the <em>certificate-transparency</em> project and run the following steps
    with that <em>virtualenv</em> activated.</li>
    <li>Set <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to include the <code>python</code>
    directory within the <em>certificate-transparency</em> tools.</li>
    <li>Set <code>PATH</code> to include the <code>python/ct/client/tools</code>
    directory.</li>
    <li>Run <code>ctauditscts</code>, passing the value of the
    <directive>CTAuditStorage</directive> directive and, optionally, the path to
    the log configuration database.  The latter will be used to look up log URLs
    by log id.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The data saved for audit can also be used by other programs; refer to the
  <code>ctauditscts</code> source code for details on processing the data.</p>

<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
  <p>The <directive>CTAuditStorage</directive> directive sets the name of a
  directory where data will be stored for off-line audit.  If <em>directory</em>
  is not absolute then it is assumed to be relative to <directive module="core">
  DefaultRuntimeDir</directive>.</p>

  <p>If this directive is not specified, data will not be stored for off-line
  audit.</p>

  <p>The directory will contain files named <code><em>PID</em>.tmp</code> for
  active child processes and files named <code><em>PID</em>.out</code> for exited
  child processes.  These <code>.out</code> files are ready for off-line audit.
  The experimental command <code>ctauditscts</code> (in the httpd source tree, not
  currently installed) interfaces with <em>certificate-transparency</em> tools to
  perform the audit.</p>

<usage>
  <p><em>executable</em> is the full path to the log client tool, which is
  normally file <code>cpp/client/ct</code> (or <code>ct.exe</code>) within the
  source tree of the
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/">
  certificate-transparency</a> open source project.</p>

  <p>An alternative implementation could be used to retrieve SCTs for a
  server certificate as long as the command-line interface is equivalent.</p>

  <p>If this directive is not configured, server certificates cannot be
  submitted to logs in order to obtain SCTs; thus, only admin-managed
  SCTs or SCTs in certificate extensions will be provided to clients.</p>

<usage>
  <p>The <directive>CTLogConfigDB</directive> directive sets the name of a database
  containing configuration about known logs.  If <em>filename</em> is not absolute
  then it is assumed to be relative to
  <directive module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</p>

  <p>Refer to the documentation for the <program>ctlogconfig</program> program,

<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
  <p>Server certificates with SCTs which are older than this maximum age will
  be resubmitted to configured logs.  Generally the log will return the same SCT
  as before, but that is subject to log operation.  SCTs will be refreshed as
  necessary during normal server operation, with new SCTs returned to clients
  as they become available.</p>

<usage>
  <p>This directive controls awareness and checks for valid SCTs for a
  proxy.  Several options are available:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>oblivious</dt>
    <dd>The proxy will neither ask for nor examine SCTs.  Certificate
    Transparency processing for the proxy is completely disabled.</dd>

    <dt>aware</dt>
    <dd>The proxy will perform all appropriate Certificate Transparency
    processing, such as asking for and examining SCTs.  However, the
    proxy will not disallow communication if the origin server does
    not provide any valid SCTs.</dd>

    <dt>require</dt>
    <dd>The proxy will abort communication with the origin server if it
    does not provide at least one SCT which passes on-line validation.</dd>

<usage>
  <p>The <directive>CTSCTStorage</directive> directive sets the name of a
  directory where SCTs and SCT lists will be stored.  If <em>directory</em>
  is not absolute then it is assumed to be relative to <directive module="core">
  DefaultRuntimeDir</directive>.</p>

  <p>A subdirectory for each server certificate contains information relative
  to that certificate; the name of the subdirectory is the SHA-256 hash of the
  certificate.</p>

  <p>The certificate-specific directory contains SCTs retrieved from configured
  logs, SCT lists prepared from statically configured SCTs and retrieved SCTs,
  and other information used for managing SCTs.</p>
</usage>

ServerHello</description>
<syntax>CTServerHelloSCTLimit <em>limit</em></syntax>
<default>100</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
  <p>This directive can be used to limit the number of SCTs which can be
  returned by a TLS server in ServerHello, in case the number of configured
  logs and statically-defined SCTs is relatively high.</p>

  <p>Typically only a few SCTs would be available, so this directive is only
  needed in special circumstances.</p>

  <p>The directive does not take into account SCTs which may be provided in
  certificate extensions or in stapled OCSP responses.</p>
</usage>

<name>CTStaticLogConfig</name>
<description>Static configuration of information about a log</description>
<syntax>CTStaticLogConfig <em>log-id|-</em> <em>public-key-file|-</em>
<em>1|0|-</em> <em>min-timestamp|-</em> <em>max-timestamp|-</em>
<em>log-URL|-</em></syntax>
<default>none</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
  <p>This directive is used to configure information about a particular log.
  This directive is appropriate when configuration information changes rarely.
  If dynamic configuration updates must be supported, refer to the
  <directive module="mod_ssl_ct">CTLogConfigDB</directive> directive.</p>

  <p>Each of the six fields must be specified, but usually only a small
  amount of information must be configured for each log; use <em>-</em> when no
  information is available for the field.  For example, in support of a
  server-only configuration (i.e., no proxy), the administrator might
  configure only the log URL to be used when submitting server certificates
  and obtaining a Signed Certificate Timestamp.</p>

  <p>The fields are defined as follows:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>log-id</em></dt>
    <dd>This is the id of the log, which is the SHA-256 hash of the log's
    public key, provided in hexadecimal format.  This string is 64 characters
    in length.
    <br />
    This field should be omitted when <em>public-key-file</em> is provided.</dd>

    <dt><em>public-key-file</em></dt>
    <dd>This is the name of a file containing the PEM encoding of the log's
    public key.  If the name is not absolute, then it is assumed to be relative
    to <directive module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</dd>

    <dt><em>trust/distrust</em></dt>
    <dd>Set this field to <em>1</em> to distrust this log, or to otherwise avoid
    using it for server certificate submission.  Set this to <em>-</em> or
    <em>0</em> (the default) to treat the log normally.</dd>

    <dt><em>min-timestamp</em> and <em>max-timestamp</em></dt>
    <dd>A timestamp is a time as expressed in the number of milliseconds since the
    epoch, ignoring leap seconds.  This is the form of time used in Signed Certificate
    Timestamps.  This must be provided as a decimal number.
    <br />
    Specify <strong><code>-</code></strong> for one of the timestamps if it is unknown.
    For example, when configuring the minimum valid timestamp for a log which remains
    valid, specify <strong><code>-</code></strong> for <em>max-timestamp</em>.
    <br />
    SCTs received from this log by the proxy are invalid if the timestamp
    is older than <em>min-timestamp</em> or newer than <em>max-timestamp</em>.</dd>

    <dt><em>log-URL</em></dt>
    <dd>This is the URL of the log, for use in submitting server certificates
    and in turn obtaining an SCT to be sent to clients.</dd>
  </dl>
</usage>

<name>CTStaticSCTs</name>
<description>Static configuration of one or more SCTs for a server certificate
</description>
<syntax>CTStaticSCTs <em>certificate-pem-file</em> <em>sct-directory</em></syntax>
<default>none</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
  <p>This directive is used to statically define one or more SCTs corresponding
  to a server certificate.  This mechanism can be used instead of or in
  addition to dynamically obtaining SCTs from configured logs.  Any changes to
  the set of SCTs for a particular server certificate will be adopted dynamically
  without the need to restart the server.</p>

  <p><em>certificate-pem-file</em> refers to the server certificate in PEM
  format.  If the name is not absolute, then it is assumed to be relative to
  <directive module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</p>

  <p><em>sct-directory</em> should contain one or more files with extension
  <code>.sct</code>, representing one or more SCTs corresponding to the
  server certificate.  If <em>sct-directory</em> is not absolute, then it is
  assumed to be relative to <directive module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</p>

  <p>If <em>sct-directory</em> is empty, no error will be raised.</p>

  <p>This directive could be used to identify directories of SCTs maintained by
  other infrastructure, provided that they are saved in binary format with
  file extension <em>.sct</em></p>
