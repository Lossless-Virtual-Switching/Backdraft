<description>Attempts to correct mistaken URLs by ignoring

<summary>

    <p>Requests to documents sometimes cannot be served by the core
    apache server because the request was misspelled or
    miscapitalized. This module addresses this problem by trying to
    find a matching document, even after all other modules gave up.
    It does its work by comparing each document name in the
    requested directory against the requested document name
    <strong>without regard to case</strong>, and allowing
    <strong>up to one misspelling</strong> (character insertion /
    omission / transposition or wrong character). A list is built
    with all document names which were matched using this
    strategy. <strong>Erroneous extension</strong> can also be fixed
    by this module.</p>

    <p>If, after scanning the directory,</p>

    <ul>
      <li>no matching document was found, Apache will proceed as
      usual and return an error (<code>404 - document not found</code>).</li>

      <li>only one document is found that "almost" matches the
      request, then it is returned in the form of a redirection
      response (<code>301 - Moved Permanently</code>).</li>

      <li>more than one document with a close match was found, then
      the list of the matches is returned to the client, and the
      client can select the correct candidate (<code>300 - Multiple
      Choices</code>).</li>
    </ul>

<usage>
    <p>This directive enables or disables the spelling module. When
    enabled, keep in mind that</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the directory scan which is necessary for the spelling
      correction will have an impact on the server's performance
      when many spelling corrections have to be performed at the
      same time.</li>

      <li>the document trees should not contain sensitive files
      which could be matched inadvertently by a spelling
      "correction".</li>

      <li>the module is unable to correct misspelled user names (as
      in <code>http://my.host/~apahce/</code>), just file names or
      directory names.</li>

      <li>spelling corrections apply strictly to existing files, so
      a request for the <code>&lt;Location /status&gt;</code> may
      get incorrectly treated as the negotiated file
      "<code>/stats.html</code>".</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- XXX: is that really true?! -nd -->
    <p><module>mod_speling</module> should not be enabled in <a href="mod_dav.html">DAV</a>
    enabled directories, because it will try to "spell fix" newly created
    resource names against existing filenames, e.g., when trying to upload
    a new document <code>doc43.html</code> it might redirect to an existing
    document <code>doc34.html</code>, which is not what was intended.

<usage>
    <p>When set, this directive limits the action of the spelling correction
    to lower/upper case changes.  Other potential corrections are not performed,
    except when <directive module="mod_speling">CheckBasenameMatch</directive> is also set.</p>

<usage>
    <p>When set, this directive extends the action of the spelling correction
    to the file name extension. For example a file <code>foo.gif</code> will
    match a request for <code>foo</code> or <code>foo.jpg</code>. This can be
    particularly useful in conjunction with
    <a href="../content-negotiation.html">MultiViews</a>.</p>
