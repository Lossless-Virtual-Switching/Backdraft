        <p>This module provides HTTP/2 (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540">RFC 7540</a>) 
        support for the Apache HTTP Server.</p>
        
        <p>This module relies on <a href="http://nghttp2.org/">libnghttp2</a>
        to provide the core http/2 engine.</p>
        
        <p>You must enable HTTP/2 via <directive module="core">Protocols</directive>
        in order to use the functionality described in this document. The
        HTTP/2 protocol <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption"
        >does not require</a> the use of encryption so two schemes are available:
        <code>h2</code> (HTTP/2 over TLS) and <code>h2c</code> (HTTP/2 over TCP).</p>

        <p>Two useful configuration schemes are:</p>

    <section id="how-it-works"><title>How it works</title>
    
    <section id="dimensioning"><title>HTTP/2 Dimensioning</title>
        <p>
            Enabling HTTP/2 on your Apache Server has impact on the resource
            consumption and if you have a busy site, you may need to consider
            carefully the implications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first noticeable thing after enabling HTTP/2 is that your server
            processes will start additional threads. The reason for this is that
            HTTP/2 gives all requests that it receives to its own <em>Worker</em>
            threads for processing, collects the results and streams them out
            to the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the current implementation, these workers use a separate thread
            pool from the MPM workers that you might be familiar with. This is
            just how things are right now and not intended to be like this forever.
            (It might be forever for the 2.4.x release line, though.) So, HTTP/2
            workers, or shorter H2Workers, will not show up in <module>mod_status</module>. They
            are also not counted against directives such as <directive module="mpm_common"
            >ThreadsPerChild</directive>. However
            they take <directive module="mpm_common">ThreadsPerChild</directive>
            as default if you have not configured something
            else via <directive module="mod_http2">H2MinWorkers</directive> and
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2MaxWorkers</directive>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing to watch out for is is memory consumption. Since HTTP/2
            keeps more state on the server to manage all the open request, priorities
            for and dependencies between them, it will always need more memory
            than HTTP/1.1 processing. There are three directives which steer the
            memory footprint of a HTTP/2 connection:
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2MaxSessionStreams</directive>,
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2WindowSize</directive> and
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2StreamMaxMemSize</directive>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2MaxSessionStreams</directive> limits the
            number of parallel requests that a client can make on a HTTP/2 connection.
            It depends on your site how many you should allow. The default is 100 which
            is plenty and unless you run into memory problems, I would keep it this
            way. Most requests that browsers send are GETs without a body, so they
            use up only a little bit of memory until the actual processing starts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <directive module="mod_http2">H2WindowSize</directive> controls how much
            the client is allowed to send as body of a request, before it waits
            for the server to encourage more. Or, the other way around, it is the
            amount of request body data the server needs to be able to buffer. This
            is per request.
        </p>
        <p>
            And last, but not least, <directive module="mod_http2">H2StreamMaxMemSize</directive>
            controls how much response data shall be buffered. The request sits in
            a H2Worker thread and is producing data, the HTTP/2 connection tries
            to send this to the client. If the client does not read fast enough,
            the connection will buffer this amount of data and then suspend the
            H2Worker.
        </p>

    <section id="misdirected"><title>Multiple Hosts and Misdirected Requests</title>
        <p>
            Many sites use the same TLS certificate for multiple virtual hosts. The 
            certificate either has a wildcard name, such as '*.example.org' or carries
            several alternate names. Browsers using HTTP/2 will recognize that and reuse
            an already opened connection for such hosts.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this is great for performance, it comes at a price: such vhosts 
            need more care in their configuration. The problem is that you will have
            multiple requests for multiple hosts on the same TLS connection. And that
            makes renegotiation impossible, in face the HTTP/2 standard forbids it.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if you have several virtual hosts using the same certificate and
            want to use HTTP/2 for them, you need to make sure that all vhosts have
            exactly the same SSL configuration. You need the same protocol, 
            ciphers and settings for client verification.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you mix things, Apache httpd will detect it and return a special
            response code, 421 Misdirected Request, to the client.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/2 Direct Mode. This
                should be used inside a 
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to enable direct HTTP/2 communication for that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct communication means that if the first bytes received by the 
                server on a connection match the HTTP/2 preamble, the HTTP/2
                protocol is switched to immediately without further negotiation.
                This mode is defined in RFC 7540 for the cleartext (h2c) case. Its
                use on TLS connections not mandated by the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a server/vhost does not have h2 or h2c enabled via
                <directive module="core">Protocols</directive>,
                the connection is never inspected for a HTTP/2 preamble.
                <directive>H2Direct</directive>
                does not matter then. This is important for connections that
                use protocols where an initial read might hang indefinitely, such
                as NNTP.
            </p>
            <p>
                For clients that have out-of-band knowledge about a server
                supporting h2c, direct HTTP/2 saves the client from having to
                perform an HTTP/1.1 upgrade, resulting in better performance
                and avoiding the Upgrade restrictions on request bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes direct h2c attractive for server to server communication
                as well, when the connection can be trusted or is secured by other means.

        <usage>
            <p>
                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/2 server push 
                protocol feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The HTTP/2 protocol allows the server to push other resources to
                a client when it asked for a particular one. This is helpful
                if those resources are connected in some way and the client can
                be expected to ask for it anyway. The pushing then saves the
                time it takes the client to ask for the resources itself. On the
                other hand, pushing resources the client never needs or already
                has is a waste of bandwidth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Server pushes are detected by inspecting the <code>Link</code> headers of
                responses (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 for the 
                specification). When a link thus specified has the <code>rel=preload</code>
                attribute, it is treated as a resource to be pushed.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Link headers in responses are either set by the application or
                can be configured via <directive>H2PushResource</directive> or
                using <module>mod_headers</module> as:
            </p>
            <example><title>mod_headers example</title>
                <highlight language="config">
&lt;Location /index.html&gt;
    Header add Link "&lt;/css/site.css&gt;;rel=preload"
    Header add Link "&lt;/images/logo.jpg&gt;;rel=preload"
&lt;/Location&gt;
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                As the example shows, there can be several link headers added
                to a response, resulting in several pushes being triggered. There
                are no checks in the module to avoid pushing the same resource
                twice or more to one client. Use with care.
            </p>
            <p> 
                HTTP/2 server pushes are enabled by default. On a server or virtual host,
                you may enable/disable this feature for any connection to the host. In addition,
                you may disable PUSH for a set of resources in a Directory/Location. This controls
                which resources may cause a PUSH, not which resources may be sent via PUSH.
            </p>

            <p>
                Last but not least, pushes happen only when the client signals
                its willingness to accept those. Most browsers do, some, like Safari 9,
                do not. Also, pushes also only happen for resources from the same
                <em>authority</em> as the original response is for.

                This directive toggles the maximum number of HTTP/2 server pushes 
                that are remembered per HTTP/2 connection. This can be used inside the
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive> 
                section to influence the number for all connections to that virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The push diary records a digest (currently using a 64 bit number) of pushed
                resources (their URL) to avoid duplicate pushes on the same connection.
                These value are not persisted, so clients opening a new connection
                will experience known pushes again. There is ongoing work to enable
                a client to disclose a digest of the resources it already has, so
                the diary maybe initialized by the client on each connection setup.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the maximum size is reached, newer entries replace the oldest
                ones. A diary entry uses 8 bytes, letting a
                default diary with 256 entries consume around 2 KB of memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                A size of 0 will effectively disable the push diary.

            <p>
                This directive defines the priority handling of pushed responses
                based on the content-type of the response. This is usually defined
                per server config, but may also appear in a virtual host. 
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP/2 server pushes are always related to a client request. Each
                such request/response pairs, or <em>streams</em> have a dependency
                and a weight, together defining the <em>priority</em> of a stream. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a stream <em>depends</em> on another, say X depends on Y,
                then Y gets all bandwidth before X gets any. Note that this
                does not mean that Y will block X. If Y has no data to send, 
                all bandwidth allocated to Y can be used by X.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a stream has more than one dependent, say X1 and X2 both
                depend on Y, the <em>weight</em> determines the bandwidth
                allocation. If X1 and X2 have the same weight, they both get
                half of the available bandwidth. If the weight of X1 is twice
                as large as that for X2, X1 gets twice the bandwidth of X2.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Ultimately, every stream depends on the <em>root</em> stream which
                gets all the bandwidth available, but never sends anything. So all
                its bandwidth is distributed by weight among its children. Which
                either have data to send or distribute the bandwidth to their
                own children. And so on. If none of the children have data
                to send, that bandwidth get distributed somewhere else according
                to the same rules.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The purpose of this priority system is to always make use of
                available bandwidth while allowing precedence and weight
                to be given to specific streams. Since, normally, all streams
                are initiated by the client, it is also the one that sets
                these priorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only when such a stream results in a PUSH, gets the server to
                decide what the <em>initial</em> priority of such a pushed
                stream is. In the examples below, X is the client stream. It
                depends on Y and the server decides to PUSH streams P1 and P2
                onto X.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default priority rule is:
            </p>
            <example><title>Default Priority Rule</title>
                <highlight language="config">
H2PushPriority * After 16
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                which reads as 'Send a pushed stream of any content-type
                depending on the client stream with weight 16'. And so P1
                and P2 will be send after X and, as they have equal weight,
                share bandwidth equally among themselves.
            </p>
            <example><title>Interleaved Priority Rule</title>
                <highlight language="config">
H2PushPriority text/css Interleaved 256
                </highlight>
            </example>
            <p>
                which reads as 'Send any CSS resource on the same dependency and
                weight as the client stream'. If P1 has content-type 'text/css',
                it will depend on Y (as does X) and its effective weight will be
                calculated as <code>P1ew = Xw * (P1w / 256)</code>. With P1w being 
                256, this will make the effective weight the same as the weight
                of X. If both X and P1 have data to send, bandwidth will be allocated
                to both equally.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Pw specified as 512, a pushed, interleaved stream would
                get double the weight of X. With 128 only half as much. Note that
                effective weights are always capped at 256.
            </p>

            </example>
            <p>
                This says that any pushed stream of content type 'application/json'
                should be send out <em>before</em> X. This makes P1 dependent
                on Y and X dependent on P1. So, X will be stalled as long as
                P1 has data to send. The effective weight is inherited from the
                client stream. Specifying a weight is not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware that the effect of priority specifications is limited
                by the available server resources. If a server does not have
                workers available for pushed streams, the data for the stream
                may only ever arrive when other streams have been finished.

                This directive toggles the usage of the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade method 
                for switching to HTTP/2. This
                should be used inside a

            <p>
                This method of switching protocols is defined in HTTP/1.1 and
                uses the "Upgrade" header (thus the name) to announce willingness
                to use another protocol. This may happen on any request of a
                HTTP/1.1 connection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method of protocol switching is enabled by default on cleartext
                (potential h2c) connections and disabled on TLS (potential h2), 
                as mandated by RFC 7540. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware that Upgrades are only accepted for requests
                that carry no body. POSTs and PUTs with content will never
                trigger an upgrade to HTTP/2.

                This directive toggles the security checks on HTTP/2 connections
                in TLS mode (https:). This can be used server wide or for specific
                <directive module="core" type="section">VirtualHost</directive>s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The security checks require that the TSL protocol is at least
                TLSv1.2 and that none of the ciphers listed in RFC 7540, Appendix A
                is used. These checks will be extended once new security requirements
                come into place.

                definitions at mozilla where "modern compatibility" is defined. Mozilla Firefox and
                other browsers require modern compatibility for HTTP/2 connections. As everything
                in OpSec, this is a moving target and can be expected to evolve in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One purpose of having these checks in <module>mod_http2</module> is to enforce this
                security level for all connections, not only those from browsers. The other
                purpose is to prevent the negotiation of HTTP/2 as a protocol should
                the requirements not be met.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the security of the TLS connection is determined by the

                While TCP adjust its flow-control and window sizes, longer TLS
                records can get stuck in queues or get lost and need retransmission.
                This is of course true for all packets. TLS however needs the 
                whole record in order to decrypt it. Any missing bytes at the end
                will stall usage of the received ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a sufficient number of bytes have been send successfully,
                the TCP state of the connection is stable and maximum TLS record
                sizes (16 KB) can be used for optimal performance.

                In deployments where servers are reached locally or over reliable
                connections only, the value might be decreased with 0 disabling
                any warmup phase altogether.

                This directive sets the number of seconds of idle time on a TLS

                for idle connections as well. It is beneficial to overall performance
                to fall back to the pre-warmup phase after a number of seconds that

            <p>
                This directive influences how file content is handled in
                responses. When <code>off</code>, which is the default, file handles
                are passed from the requestion processing down to the main
                connection, using the usual Apache setaside handling for
                managing the lifetime of the file.
            </p>
            <p>
                When set to <code>on</code>, file content is copied while the
                request is still being processed and the buffered data is passed
                on to the main connection. This is better if a third party
                module is injecting files with different lifetimes into the response. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An example for such a module is <code>mod_wsgi</code> that may place
                Python file handles into the response. Those files get close down when
                Python thinks processing has finished. That may be well before
                <module>mod_http2</module> is done with them.

            <p>
                When added to a directory/location HTTP/2 PUSHes will be attempted
                for all paths added via this directive. This directive can be used
                several times for the same location.

                This directive pushes resources much earlier than adding 
                <code>Link</code> headers via <module>mod_headers</module>.
                <module>mod_http2</module> announces these resources in a
                <code>103 Early Hints</code> interim response to the client.
                That means that clients not supporting PUSH will still get
                early preload hints.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to setting <code>Link</code> response headers 
                via <module>mod_headers</module>, this directive will only
                take effect on HTTP/2 connections.

            <p>
                By adding <code>critical</code> to such a resource, the server
                will give processing it more preference and send its data, once
                available, before the data from the main request.

                This setting controls if HTTP status 103 interim responses are
                forwarded to the client or not. By default, this is currently 
                not the case since a range of clients still have trouble with
                unexpected interim responses.

                When set to <code>on</code>, PUSH resources announced with
                <code>H2PushResource</code> will trigger an interim 103 response
                before the final response. The 103 response will carry <code>Link</code>
                headers that advise the <code>preload</code> of such resources.

        <usage>
            <p>
                With the default 0, no padding bytes are added to any payload
                frames, e.g. HEADERS, DATA and PUSH_PROMISE. This is the behaviour
                of previous versions. It means that under certain conditions, an
                observer of network traffic can see the length of those frames 
                in the TLS stream.
            </p>
            <p>
                When configuring numbits of 1-8, a random number in range
                [0, 2^numbits[ are added to each frame. The random value is chosen
                independently for each frame that the module sends back to the client.
            </p>
            <p>
                While more padding bytes give better message length obfuscation, they
                are also additional traffic. The optimal number therefore depends on
                the kind of web traffic the server carries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default of 0, e.g. no padding, was chosen for maximum backward
                compatibility. There might be deployments where padding bytes are
                unwanted or do harm. The most likely cause would be a client that
                has a faults implementation.
