<summary>
    <p>This module provides authorization capabilities so that
    authenticated users can be allowed or denied access to portions
    of the web site by group membership. Similar functionality is
    provided by <module>mod_authz_dbm</module>.</p>

<section id="requiredirectives"><title>The Require Directives</title>

    <p>Apache's <directive module="mod_authz_core">Require</directive>
    directives are used during the authorization phase to ensure that
    a user is allowed to access a resource.  mod_authz_groupfile extends the
    authorization types with <code>group</code> and <code>group-file</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Since v2.4.8, <a href="../expr.html">expressions</a> are supported
    within the groupfile require directives.</p>

<section id="reqgroup"><title>Require group</title>

    <p>This directive specifies group membership that is required for the
    user to gain access.</p>

    <highlight language="config">
      Require group admin
    </highlight>

</section>

<section id="reqfilegroup"><title>Require file-group</title>

    <p>When this directive is specified, the filesystem permissions on
    the file being accessed are consulted. The user must be a member of
    a group with the same name as the group that owns the file.
    See <module>mod_authz_owner</module> for more
    details.</p>

<name>AuthGroupFile</name>
<description>Sets the name of a text file containing the list
of user groups for authorization</description>
<syntax>AuthGroupFile <var>file-path</var></syntax>
<contextlist><context>directory</context><context>.htaccess</context>
</contextlist>
<override>AuthConfig</override>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive> directive sets the
    name of a textual file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization. <var>File-path</var> is the path to the group
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the <directive
    module="core">ServerRoot</directive>.</p>

    <p>Each line of the group file contains a groupname followed by a
    colon, followed by the member usernames separated by spaces.</p>

    <example><title>Example:</title>
      mygroup: bob joe anne
    </example>

    <p>Note that searching large text files is <em>very</em>
    inefficient; <directive module="mod_authz_dbm"
    >AuthDBMGroupFile</directive> provides a much better performance.</p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Security</title>
      <p>Make sure that the <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive> is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server; do <em>not</em>
      put it in the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients may
      be able to download the <directive>AuthGroupFile</directive>.</p>
