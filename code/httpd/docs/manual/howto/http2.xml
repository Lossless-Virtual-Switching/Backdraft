  <section id="protocol">
    <title>The HTTP/2 protocol</title>
    <p>HTTP/2 is the evolution of the world's most successful application layer protocol, HTTP.
    It focuses on making more efficient use of network resources. It does not change the fundamentals
    of HTTP, the semantics. There are still request and responses and headers and all that. So, if
    you already know HTTP/1, you know 95% about HTTP/2 as well.</p>
    <p>There has been a lot written about HTTP/2 and how it works. The most normative is, of course,
    its <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540">RFC 7540</a> 
    (<a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html">also available in more readable formatting, YMMV</a>).
    So, there you'll find the nuts and bolts.</p>
    <p>But, as RFC do, it's not really a good thing to read first. It's better to first understand
    <em>what</em> a thing wants to do and then read the RFC about <em>how</em> it is done. A much
    better document to start with is <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/http2/">http2  explained</a>
    by Daniel Stenberg, the author of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</a>. It is available in
    an ever growing list of languages, too!</p>
    <p>Too Long, Didn't read: there are some new terms and gotchas that need to be kept in mind while reading this document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTP/2 is a <strong>binary protocol</strong>, as opposed to HTTP 1.1 that is plain text. The latter is meant to be human readable (for example sniffing network traffic) meanwhile the former is not. More info in the official FAQ <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-binary">question</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>h2</strong> is HTTP/2 over TLS (protocol negotiation via ALPN).</li>
        <li><strong>h2c</strong> is HTTP/2 over TCP.</li>
        <li>A <strong>frame</strong> is the smallest unit of communication within an HTTP/2 connection, consisting of a header and a variable-length sequence of octets structured according to the frame type. More info in the official documentation <a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#FramingLayer"> section</a>.</li>
        <li>A <strong>stream</strong> is a bidirectional flow of frames within the HTTP/2 connection. The correspondent concept in HTTP 1.1 is a request/response message exchange. More info in the official documentation <a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#StreamsLayer"> section</a>.</li>
        <li>HTTP/2 is able to run <strong>multiple streams</strong> of data over the same TCP connection, avoiding the classic HTTP 1.1 head of blocking slow request and avoiding to re-instantiate TCP connections for each request/response (KeepAlive patched the problem in HTTP 1.1 but did not fully solve it).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="implementation">
    <title>HTTP/2 in Apache httpd</title>
    <p>The HTTP/2 protocol is implemented by its own httpd module, aptly named
    <module>mod_http2</module>. It implements the complete set
    of features described by RFC 7540 and supports HTTP/2 over cleartext (http:), as
    well as secure (https:) connections. The cleartext variant is named '<code>h2c</code>', 
    the secure one '<code>h2</code>'. For <code>h2c</code> it allows the <em>direct</em>
    mode and the <code>Upgrade:</code> via an initial HTTP/1 request.</p>
    <p>One feature of HTTP/2 that offers new capabilities for web developers is
    <a href="#push">Server Push</a>. See that section on how your web application
    can make use of it.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="building">
    <title>Build httpd with HTTP/2 support</title>
    <p><module>mod_http2</module> uses the library of <a href="https://nghttp2.org">nghttp2</a>
    as its implementation base. In order to build <module>mod_http2</module> you need at least version 1.2.1 of
    <code>libnghttp2</code> installed on your system.</p>
    <p>When you <code>./configure</code> you Apache httpd source tree, you need to give it 
    '<code>--enable-http2</code>' as additional argument to trigger the build of the module.
    Should your <code>libnghttp2</code> reside in an unusual place (whatever that is on your
    operating system), you may announce its location with '<code>--with-nghttp2=&lt;path&gt;</code>'
    to <code>configure</code>.</p>
    <p>While that should do the trick for most, they are people who might prefer a statically
    linked <code>nghttp2</code> in this module. For those, the option <code>--enable-nghttp2-staticlib-deps</code>
    exists. It works quite similar to how one statically links openssl to <module>mod_ssl</module>.</p>
    <p>Speaking of SSL, you need to be aware that most browsers will speak HTTP/2 only on <code>https:</code>
    URLs, so you need a server with SSL support. But not only that, you will need a SSL library
    that supports the <code>ALPN</code> extension. If OpenSSL is the library you use, you need
    at least version 1.0.2.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="basic-config">
    <title>Basic Configuration</title>

    <p>When you have a <code>httpd</code> built with <module>mod_http2</module> you need some
    basic configuration for it becoming active. The first thing, as with every Apache module,
    is that you need to load it:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
LoadModule http2_module modules/mod_http2.so
    </highlight>
    
    <p>The second directive you need to add to your server configuration is</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Protocols h2 http/1.1
</highlight>
    <p>This allows h2, the secure variant, to be the preferred protocol on your server
    connections. When you want to enable all HTTP/2 variants, you simply write:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
</highlight>
    <p>Depending on where you put this directive, it affects all connections or just
    the ones to a certain virtual host. You can nest it, as in:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Protocols http/1.1
&lt;VirtualHost ...&gt;
    ServerName test.example.org
    Protocols h2 http/1.1
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</highlight>

    <p>This allows only HTTP/1 on connections, except SSL connections to <code>test.example.org</code>
    which offer HTTP/2.</p>
    <note><title>Choose a strong SSLCipherSuite</title>
    <p>The <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLCipherSuite</directive> needs to be configured with
    a strong TLS cipher suite. The current version of <module>mod_http2</module> does not enforce any cipher but most
    clients do so. Pointing a browser to a <code>h2</code> enabled server with a inappropriate
    cipher suite will force it to simply refuse and fall back to HTTP 1.1. This is a common mistake
    that is done while configuring httpd for HTTP/2 the first time, so please keep it in mind to avoid
    long debugging sessions! If you want to be sure about the cipher suite to choose please avoid
    the ones listed in the <a href="http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#BadCipherSuites">HTTP/2 TLS reject list</a>.</p>
    </note>
    <p>The order of protocols mentioned is also relevant. By default, the first one is the 
    most preferred protocol. When a client offers multiple choices, the one most to the 
    left is selected. In</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Protocols http/1.1 h2
</highlight>
    <p>the most preferred protocol is HTTP/1 and it will always be selected unless a 
    client <em>only</em> supports h2. Since we want to talk HTTP/2 to clients that
    support it, the better order is</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
</highlight>

    <p>There is one more thing to ordering: the client has its own preferences, too. If
    you want, you can configure your server to select the protocol most preferred by
    the client:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
ProtocolsHonorOrder Off
    </highlight>
    <p>makes the order <em>you</em> wrote the Protocols irrelevant and only the client's
    ordering will decide.</p>
    <p>A last thing: the protocols you configure are not checked for correctness
    or spelling. You can mention protocols that do not exist, so there is no need
    to guard <directive module="core">Protocols</directive> with any
    <directive type="section" module="core">IfModule</directive> checks.</p>
    <p>For more advanced tips on configuration, see the <a href="../mod/mod_http2.html#dimensioning">
    modules section about dimensioning</a> and <a href="../mod/mod_http2.html#misdirected">
    how to manage multiple hosts with the same certificate</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="mpm-config">
    <title>MPM Configuration</title>
    
    <p>HTTP/2 is supported in all multi-processing modules that come with httpd. However, if
    you use the <module>prefork</module> mpm, there will be severe restrictions.</p>
    <p>In <module>prefork</module>, <module>mod_http2</module> will only process one request at at time
    per connection. But clients, such as browsers, will send many requests at the same time.
    If one of these takes long to process (or is a long polling one), the other requests will
    stall.</p>
    <p><module>mod_http2</module> will not work around this limit by default. The reason is that
    <module>prefork</module> is today only chosen, if you run processing engines that are not
    prepared for multi-threading, e.g. will crash with more than one request.</p>
    <p>If your setup can handle it, configuring <module>event</module> mpm is nowadays
    the best one (if supported on your platform).</p>
    <p>If you are really stuck with <module>prefork</module> and want multiple requests,
    you can tweak the <directive module="mod_http2">H2MinWorkers</directive> to make
    that possible. If it breaks, however, you own both parts.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="clients">
    <title>Clients</title>
    <p>Almost all modern browsers support HTTP/2, but only over SSL connections: Firefox (v43),
    Chrome (v45), Safari (since v9), iOS Safari (v9), Opera (v35), Chrome for Android (v49)
    and Internet Explorer (v11 on Windows10) (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=http2">source</a>).</p>
    <p>Other clients, as well as servers, are listed 
    <a href="https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations">on the Implementations wiki</a>,
    among them implementations for c, c++, common lisp, dart, erlang, haskell, java, nodejs,  php, 
    python, perl, ruby, rust, scala and swift.</p>
    <p>Several of the non-browser client implementations support HTTP/2 over cleartext, h2c. The
    most versatile being <a href="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tools">
    <title>Useful tools to debug HTTP/2</title>
    <p>The first tool to mention is of course <a href="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</a>. Please make sure that
    your version supports HTTP/2 checking its <code>Features</code>:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
    $ curl -V
    curl 7.45.0 (x86_64-apple-darwin15.0.0) libcurl/7.45.0 OpenSSL/1.0.2d zlib/1.2.8 nghttp2/1.3.4

    <p>And for really deep inspection <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/HTTP2">wireshark</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://nghttp2.org">nghttp2</a> package also includes clients, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/nghttp.1.html">nghttp</a> - useful to visualize the HTTP/2 frames and get a better idea of the protocol.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Chrome offers detailed HTTP/2 logs on its connections via the 
    <a href="chrome://net-internals/#http2">special net-internals page</a>. There is also an
    interesting extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http2-and-spdy-indicator/mpbpobfflnpcgagjijhmgnchggcjblin?hl=en">Chrome</a>
    and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/spdy-indicator/">Firefox</a>
    to visualize when your browser is using HTTP/2.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="push">
    <title>Server Push</title>
    <p>The HTTP/2 protocol allows the server to PUSH responses to a client it never
    asked for. The tone of the conversation is: &quot;here is a request that you
    never sent and the response to it will arrive soon...&quot;</p>
    <p>But there are restrictions: the client can disable this feature and the
    server may only ever PUSH on a request that came from the client.</p>
    <p>The intention is to allow the server to send resources to the client that
    it will most likely need: a css or javascript resource that belongs to a html
    page the client requested. A set of images that is referenced by a css, etc.</p>
    <p>The advantage for the client is that it saves the time to send the request which
    may range from a few milliseconds to half a second, depending on where on the 
    globe both are located. The disadvantage is that the client may get sent
    things it already has in its cache. Sure, HTTP/2 allows for the early cancellation
    of such requests, but still there are resources wasted.</p>
    <p>To summarize: there is no one good strategy on how to make best use of this 
    feature of HTTP/2 and everyone is still experimenting. So, how do you experiment
    with it in Apache httpd?</p>
    <p><module>mod_http2</module> inspect response header for <code>Link</code> headers
    in a certain format:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Link &lt;/xxx.css&gt;;rel=preload, &lt;/xxx.js&gt;; rel=preload
    </highlight>
    <p>If the connection supports PUSH, these two resources will be sent to the
    client. As a web developer, you may set these headers either directly in
    your application response or you configure the server via</p>
    <highlight language="config">
&lt;Location /xxx.html&gt;
    Header add Link "&lt;/xxx.css&gt;;rel=preload"
    Header add Link "&lt;/xxx.js&gt;;rel=preload"
&lt;/Location&gt;
    </highlight>
    <p>If you want to use <code>preload</code> links without triggering a PUSH, you
    can use the <code>nopush</code> parameter, as in</p>
    <highlight language="config">
Link &lt;/xxx.css&gt;;rel=preload;nopush
    </highlight>
    <p>or you may disable PUSHes for your server entirely with the directive</p>
    <highlight language="config">
H2Push Off
    </highlight>
    <p>And there is more:</p>
    <p>The module will keep a diary of what has been PUSHed for each connection
    (hashes of URLs, basically) and will not PUSH the same resource twice. When
    the connection closes, this information is discarded.</p>
    <p>There are people thinking about how a client can tell a server what it
    already has, so PUSHes for those things can be avoided, but this is all
    highly experimental right now.</p>
    <p>Another experimental draft that has been implemented in <module>mod_http2</module>
    is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ruellan-http-accept-push-policy-00">
    Accept-Push-Policy Header Field</a> where a client can, for each request, define
    what kind of PUSHes it accepts.</p>
    <p>
    PUSH might not always trigger the request/response/performance that one expects or 
    hopes for. There are various studies on this topic to be found on the web that explain
    benefits and weaknesses and how different features of client and network influence
    the outcome. For example: just because the server PUSHes a resource does not mean
    a browser will actually use the data.</p>
    <p>The major thing that influences the response being PUSHed is the request that was
    simulated. The request URL for a PUSH is given by the application, but where do the
    request headers come from? For example, will the PUSH request a <code>accept-language</code>
    header and if yes with what value?</p>
    <p>Apache will look at the original request (the one that triggered the PUSH) and copy the 
    following headers over to PUSH requests: <code>user-agent</code>, <code>accept</code>, 
    <code>accept-encoding</code>, <code>accept-language</code>, <code>cache-control</code>.</p>
    <p>All other headers are ignored. Cookies will also not be copied over. PUSHing resources
    that require a cookie to be present will not work. This can be a matter of debate. But 
    unless this is more clearly discussed with browser, let's err on the side of caution and
    not expose cookie where they might ordinarily not be visible.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="earlyhints">
    <title>Early Hints</title>
    <p>An alternative to PUSHing resources is to send <code>Link</code> headers to the
    client before the response is even ready. This uses the HTTP feature called "Early Hints" and
    is described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8297">RFC 8297</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to use this, you need to explicitly enable it on the server via</p>
    <highlight language="config">
H2EarlyHints on
    </highlight>
    <p>(It is not enabled by default since some older browser tripped on such responses.)</p>
    <p>If this feature is on, you can use the directive <directive module="mod_http2">H2PushResource</directive> to 
    trigger early hints and resource PUSHes:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
&lt;Location /xxx.html&gt;
    H2PushResource /xxx.css
    H2PushResource /xxx.js
&lt;/Location&gt;
    </highlight>
    <p>This will send out a <code>"103 Early Hints"</code> response to a client as soon
    as the server <em>starts</em> processing the request. This may be much early than
    the time the first response headers have been determined, depending on your web
    application.</p>
    <p>If <directive module="mod_http2">H2Push</directive> is enabled, this will also start the PUSH right after the
    103 response. If <directive module="mod_http2">H2Push</directive> is disabled however, the 103 response will be send
    nevertheless to the client.</p>
