<description>
This build file contains all operations that are necessary for building
the Apache httpd documentation. It is called by invoking build.bat (Win32)
or build.sh (/bin/sh systems) with a target argument (full list below).
For example, if you want to build the Japanese HTML files, type:

  ./build.sh ja

Some targets have additional requirements:

* 'metafiles' and 'modulelists' need perl in PATH. (It's checked automatically
  and skipped if perl is not available)

* 'chm-foo' targets need:
  - the HTML Help compiler in PATH (or modify this build file). The
    compiler (hhc.exe) is part of the HTML Help Workshop which is freely
    available and can be downloaded from
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms669985%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
  - The appropriate locale (e.g. Japanese) before invoking hhc.exe. Otherwise
    the compiler is not able to build the fulltext search index correctly and
    the TOC may be garbled, too. In particular:
    + chm-de: German (Germany), sorting order: dictionary
    + chm-en: English (USA)
    + chm-es: Spanish (Spain), sorting order: international
    + chm-fr: French (France)
    + chm-ja: Japanese
    + chm-ko: Korean
    + chm-tr: Turkish
    + chm-zh-cn: Chinese (China), sorting order: phonetic
