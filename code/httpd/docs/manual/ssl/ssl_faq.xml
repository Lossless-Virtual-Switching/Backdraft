<section id="mutex"><title>Why do I get permission errors related to
        SSLMutex when I start Apache?</title>
    <p>Errors such as ``<code>mod_ssl: Child could not open
    SSLMutex lockfile /opt/apache/logs/ssl_mutex.18332 (System error follows)
    [...] System: Permission denied (errno: 13)</code>'' are usually
    caused by overly restrictive permissions on the <em>parent</em> directories.
    Make sure that all parent directories (here <code>/opt</code>,
    <code>/opt/apache</code> and <code>/opt/apache/logs</code>) have the x-bit
    set for, at minimum, the UID under which Apache's children are running (see
    the <directive module="mod_unixd">User</directive> directive).</p>
</section>

<section id="entropy"><title>Why does mod_ssl stop with the error
        "Failed to generate temporary 512 bit RSA private key" when I start
        Apache?</title>
    <p>Cryptographic software needs a source of unpredictable data
    to work correctly. Many open source operating systems provide
    a "randomness device" that serves this purpose (usually named
    <code>/dev/random</code>). On other systems, applications have to
    seed the OpenSSL Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) manually with
    appropriate data before generating keys or performing public key
    encryption. As of version 0.9.5, the OpenSSL functions that need
    randomness report an error if the PRNG has not been seeded with
    at least 128 bits of randomness.</p>
    <p>To prevent this error, <module>mod_ssl</module> has to provide
    enough entropy to the PRNG to allow it to work correctly. This can
    be done via the <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLRandomSeed</directive>
    directive.</p>

</ul>

<section id="parallel"><title>Is it possible to provide HTTP and HTTPS
        from the same server?</title>
    <p>Yes. HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports (HTTP binds to
    port 80, HTTPS to port 443), so there is no direct conflict between
    them. You can either run two separate server instances bound to
    these ports, or use Apache's elegant virtual hosting facility to
    create two virtual servers, both served by the same instance of Apache
    - one responding over HTTP to requests on port 80, and the other
    responding over HTTPS to requests on port 443.</p>
</section>

<section id="ports"><title>Which port does HTTPS use?</title>
<p>You can run HTTPS on any port, but the standards specify port 443, which
    is where any HTTPS compliant browser will look by default. You can force
    your browser to look on a different port by specifying it in the URL. For
    example, if your server is set up to serve pages over HTTPS on port 8080,
    you can access them at <code>https://example.com:8080/</code></p>
</section>

<section id="httpstest"><title>How do I speak HTTPS manually for testing purposes?</title>
 <p>While you usually just use</p>

    <example>$ telnet localhost 80<br />
    GET / HTTP/1.0</example>

    <p>for simple testing of Apache via HTTP, it's not so easy for
    HTTPS because of the SSL protocol between TCP and HTTP. With the
    help of OpenSSL's <code>s_client</code> command, however, you can
    do a similar check via HTTPS:</p>

    <example>$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug<br />
    GET / HTTP/1.0</example>

    <p>Before the actual HTTP response you will receive detailed
    information about the SSL handshake. For a more general command
    line client which directly understands both HTTP and HTTPS, can
    perform GET and POST operations, can use a proxy, supports byte
    ranges, etc. you should have a look at the nifty
    <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> tool. Using this, you can
    check that Apache is responding correctly to requests via HTTP and
    HTTPS as follows:</p>

    <example>$ curl http://localhost/<br />
    $ curl https://localhost/</example>
</section>

<section id="hang"><title>Why does the connection hang when I connect
    to my SSL-aware Apache server?</title>

<p>This can happen when you try to connect to a HTTPS server (or virtual
    server) via HTTP (eg, using <code>http://example.com/</code> instead of
    <code>https://example.com</code>). It can also happen when trying to
    connect via HTTPS to a HTTP server (eg, using
    <code>https://example.com/</code> on a server which doesn't support HTTPS,
    or which supports it on a non-standard port). Make sure that you're
    connecting to a (virtual) server that supports SSL.</p></section>

<section id="refused"><title>Why do I get ``Connection Refused'' messages,
    when trying to access my newly installed Apache+mod_ssl server via HTTPS?</title>
<p>
    This error can be caused by an incorrect configuration.
    Please make sure that your <directive module="mpm_common"
    >Listen</directive> directives match your
    <directive type="section" module="core">VirtualHost</directive>
    directives. If all else fails, please start afresh, using the default
    configuration provided by <module>mod_ssl</module>.</p>
</section>

<section id="envvars"><title>Why are the <code>SSL_XXX</code> variables
    not available to my CGI &amp; SSI scripts?</title>
<p>Please make sure you have ``<code>SSLOptions +StdEnvVars</code>''
    enabled for the context of your CGI/SSI requests.</p>
</section>

<section id="relative">
<title>How can I switch between HTTP and HTTPS in relative
    hyperlinks?</title>
<p>Usually, to switch between HTTP and HTTPS, you have to use
    fully-qualified hyperlinks (because you have to change the URL
    scheme).  Using <module>mod_rewrite</module> however, you can
    manipulate relative hyperlinks, to achieve the same effect.</p>
    <highlight language="config">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule   "^/(.*)_SSL$"   "https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1" [R,L]
RewriteRule   "^/(.*)_NOSSL$" "http://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1"  [R,L]
    </highlight>

    <p>This rewrite ruleset lets you use hyperlinks of the form
    <code>&lt;a href="document.html_SSL"&gt;</code>, to switch to HTTPS
    in a relative link. (Replace SSL with NOSSL to switch to HTTP.)</p>

<section id="keyscerts"><title>What are RSA Private Keys, CSRs and Certificates?</title>
<p>An RSA private key file is a digital file that you can use to decrypt
    messages sent to you. It has a public component which you distribute (via
    your Certificate file) which allows people to encrypt those messages to
    you.</p>
    <p>A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a digital file which contains
    your public key and your name. You send the CSR to a Certifying Authority
    (CA), who will convert it into a real Certificate, by signing it.</p>
    <p>A Certificate contains your
    RSA public key, your name, the name of the CA, and is digitally signed by
    the CA. Browsers that know the CA can verify the signature on that
    Certificate, thereby obtaining your RSA public key. That enables them to
    send messages which only you can decrypt.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="ssl_intro.html">Introduction</a> chapter for a general
    description of the SSL protocol.</p>
</section>

<section id="startup"><title>Is there a difference on startup between
    a non-SSL-aware Apache and an SSL-aware Apache?</title>
<p>Yes. In general, starting Apache with
    <module>mod_ssl</module> built-in is just like starting Apache
    without it. However, if you have a passphrase on your SSL private
    key file, a startup dialog will pop up which asks you to enter the
    pass phrase.</p>

    <p>Having to manually enter the passphrase when starting the server
    can be problematic - for example, when starting the server from the
    system boot scripts. In this case, you can follow the steps
    <a href="#removepassphrase">below</a> to remove the passphrase from
    your private key. Bear in mind that doing so brings additional security
    risks - proceed with caution!</p>
</section>

<section id="selfcert"><title>How do I create a self-signed SSL
Certificate for testing purposes?</title>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure OpenSSL is installed and in your <code>PATH</code>.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>Run the following command, to create <code>server.key</code> and
        <code>server.crt</code> files:<br />
        <code><strong>$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt
                        -keyout server.key</strong></code><br />
        These can be used as follows in your <code>httpd.conf</code>
        file:
        <highlight language="config">
SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/this/server.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/this/server.key
        </highlight>
    </li>
    <li>It is important that you are aware that this
        <code>server.key</code> does <em>not</em> have any passphrase.
        To add a passphrase to the key, you should run the following
        command, and enter &amp; verify the passphrase as requested.<br />
        <p><code><strong>$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out
        server.key.new</strong></code><br />
        <code><strong>$ mv server.key.new server.key</strong></code><br /></p>
        Please backup the <code>server.key</code> file, and the passphrase
        you entered, in a secure location.
    </li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section id="realcert"><title>How do I create a real SSL Certificate?</title>
<p>Here is a step-by-step description:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure OpenSSL is installed and in your <code>PATH</code>.
    <br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>Create a RSA private key for your Apache server
       (will be Triple-DES encrypted and PEM formatted):<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       Please backup this <code>server.key</code> file and the
       pass-phrase you entered in a secure location.
       You can see the details of this RSA private key by using the command:<br />

       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       If necessary, you can also create a decrypted PEM version (not
       recommended) of this RSA private key with:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.unsecure</strong></code><br />
       <br />

    </li>
    <li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with the server RSA private
       key (output will be PEM formatted):<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       Make sure you enter the FQDN ("Fully Qualified Domain Name") of the
       server when OpenSSL prompts you for the "CommonName", i.e. when you
       generate a CSR for a website which will be later accessed via
       <code>https://www.foo.dom/</code>, enter "www.foo.dom" here.
       You can see the details of this CSR by using<br />

       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -noout -text -in server.csr</strong></code><br />
       <br />
    </li>
    <li>You now have to send this Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to
       a Certifying Authority (CA) to be signed. Once the CSR has been
       signed, you will have a real Certificate, which can be used by
       Apache. You can have a CSR signed by a commercial CA, or you can
       create your own CA to sign it.<br />
       Commercial CAs usually ask you to post the CSR into a web form,
       pay for the signing, and then send a signed Certificate, which
       you can store in a server.crt file.<br />

       For details on how to create your own CA, and use this to sign
       a CSR, see <a href="#ownca">below</a>.<br />

       Once your CSR has been signed, you can see the details of the
       Certificate as follows:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code><br />

    </li>
    <li>You should now have two files: <code>server.key</code> and
    <code>server.crt</code>. These can be used as follows in your
    <code>httpd.conf</code> file:
       <highlight language="config">
SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/this/server.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/this/server.key
       </highlight>
       The <code>server.csr</code> file is no longer needed.
    </li>

    </ol>
</section>

<section id="ownca"><title>How do I create and use my own Certificate Authority (CA)?</title>
    <p>The short answer is to use the <code>CA.sh</code> or <code>CA.pl</code>
    script provided by OpenSSL. Unless you have a good reason not to,
    you should use these for preference. If you cannot, you can create a
    self-signed certificate as follows:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Create a RSA private key for your server
       (will be Triple-DES encrypted and PEM formatted):<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       Please backup this <code>server.key</code> file and the
       pass-phrase you entered in a secure location.
       You can see the details of this RSA private key by using the
       command:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       If necessary, you can also create a decrypted PEM version (not
       recommended) of this RSA private key with:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.unsecure</strong></code><br />
       <br />
    </li>
    <li>Create a self-signed Certificate (X509 structure)
       with the RSA key you just created (output will be PEM formatted):<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365
                       -key server.key -out server.crt -extensions usr_cert</strong></code><br />
       <br />
       This signs the server CSR and results in a <code>server.crt</code> file.<br />
       You can see the details of this Certificate using:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code><br />
       <br />
    </li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section id="passphrase"><title>How can I change the pass-phrase on my private key file?</title>
<p>You simply have to read it with the old pass-phrase and write it again,
    specifying the new pass-phrase. You can accomplish this with the following commands:</p>


    <p><code><strong>$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new</strong></code><br />
    <code><strong>$ mv server.key.new server.key</strong></code><br /></p>

    <p>The first time you're asked for a PEM pass-phrase, you should
    enter the old pass-phrase. After that, you'll be asked again to
    enter a pass-phrase - this time, use the new pass-phrase. If you
    are asked to verify the pass-phrase, you'll need to enter the new
    pass-phrase a second time.</p>
</section>

<section id="removepassphrase"><title>How can I get rid of the pass-phrase dialog at Apache startup time?</title>
<p>The reason this dialog pops up at startup and every re-start
    is that the RSA private key inside your server.key file is stored in
    encrypted format for security reasons. The pass-phrase is needed to decrypt
    this file, so it can be read and parsed. Removing the pass-phrase
    removes a layer of security from your server - proceed with caution!</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove the encryption from the RSA private key (while
       keeping a backup copy of the original file):<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ cp server.key server.key.org</strong></code><br />
       <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</strong></code><br />

       <br />
    </li>
    <li>Make sure the server.key file is only readable by root:<br />
       <br />
       <code><strong>$ chmod 400 server.key</strong></code><br />
       <br />
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now <code>server.key</code> contains an unencrypted copy of the key.
    If you point your server at this file, it will not prompt you for a
    pass-phrase. HOWEVER, if anyone gets this key they will be able to
    impersonate you on the net. PLEASE make sure that the permissions on this
    file are such that only root or the web server user can read it
    (preferably get your web server to start as root but run as another
    user, and have the key readable only by root).</p>

    <p>As an alternative approach you can use the ``<code>SSLPassPhraseDialog
    exec:/path/to/program</code>'' facility. Bear in mind that this is
    neither more nor less secure, of course.</p>
</section>

<section id="verify"><title>How do I verify that a private key matches its Certificate?</title>
<p>A private key contains a series of numbers. Two of these numbers form
    the "public key", the others are part of the "private key". The "public
    key" bits are included when you generate a CSR, and subsequently form
    part of the associated Certificate.</p>
    <p>To check that the public key in your Certificate matches the public
    portion of your private key, you simply need to compare these numbers.
    To view the Certificate and the key run the commands:</p>

    <p><code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code><br />
    <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code></p>

    <p>The `modulus' and the `public exponent' portions in the key and the
    Certificate must match. As the public exponent is usually 65537
    and it's difficult to visually check that the long modulus numbers
    are the same, you can use the following approach:</p>

    <p><code><strong>$ openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | openssl md5</strong></code><br />
    <code><strong>$ openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5</strong></code></p>

    <p>This leaves you with two rather shorter numbers to compare. It is,
    in theory, possible that these numbers may be the same, without the
    modulus numbers being the same, but the chances of this are
    overwhelmingly remote.</p>
    <p>Should you wish to check to which key or certificate a particular
    CSR belongs you can perform the same calculation on the CSR as
    follows:</p>

    <p><code><strong>$ openssl req -noout -modulus -in server.csr | openssl md5</strong></code></p>
</section>

<section id="pemder"><title>How can I convert a certificate from PEM to DER format?</title>
<p>The default certificate format for OpenSSL is PEM, which is simply
    Base64 encoded DER, with header and footer lines. For some applications
    (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer) you need the certificate in plain DER
    format. You can convert a PEM file <code>cert.pem</code> into the
    corresponding DER file <code>cert.der</code> using the following command:
    <code><strong>$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -out cert.der -outform DER</strong></code></p>
</section>

<section id="gid"><title>Why do browsers complain that they cannot verify my server certificate?</title>

    <p>One reason this might happen is because your server certificate is signed
    by an intermediate CA. Various CAs, such as Verisign or Thawte, have started
    signing certificates not with their root certificate but with intermediate
    certificates.</p>

    <p>Intermediate CA certificates lie between the root CA certificate (which is
    installed in the browsers) and the server certificate (which you installed
    on the server). In order for the browser to be able to traverse and verify
    the trust chain from the server certificate to the root certificate it
    needs need to be given the intermediate certificates. The CAs should
    be able to provide you such intermediate certificate packages that can be
    installed on the server.</p>

    <p>You need to include those intermediate certificates with the
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLCertificateChainFile</directive>
    directive.</p>

    cache is the most likely source of the problem, so using the SHM session cache (or
    no cache at all) may help.</p>
</section>

<section id="load"><title>Why does my webserver have a higher load, now
that it serves SSL encrypted traffic?</title>
<p>SSL uses strong cryptographic encryption, which necessitates a lot of
    number crunching. When you request a webpage via HTTPS, everything (even
    the images) is encrypted before it is transferred. So increased HTTPS
    traffic leads to load increases.</p>
</section>

<section id="establishing"><title>Why do HTTPS connections to my server
sometimes take up to 30 seconds to establish a connection?</title>
<p>This is usually caused by a <code>/dev/random</code> device for
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLRandomSeed</directive> which blocks the
    read(2) call until enough entropy is available to service the
    request. More information is available in the reference
    manual for the <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLRandomSeed</directive>
    directive.</p>
</section>

<section id="ciphers"><title>What SSL Ciphers are supported by mod_ssl?</title>
<p>Usually, any SSL ciphers supported by the version of OpenSSL in use,
    are also supported by <module>mod_ssl</module>. Which ciphers are
    available can depend on the way you built OpenSSL. Typically, at
    least the following ciphers are supported:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>RC4 with SHA1</li>
    <li>AES with SHA1</li>
    <li>Triple-DES with SHA1</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To determine the actual list of ciphers available, you should run
    the following:</p>
    <example>$ openssl ciphers -v</example>
</section>

<section id="adh"><title>Why do I get ``no shared cipher'' errors, when
trying to use Anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) ciphers?</title>
<p>By default, OpenSSL does <em>not</em> allow ADH ciphers, for security
    reasons. Please be sure you are aware of the potential side-effects
    if you choose to enable these ciphers.</p>
    <p>In order to use Anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) ciphers, you must
    build OpenSSL with ``<code>-DSSL_ALLOW_ADH</code>'', and then add
    ``<code>ADH</code>'' into your <directive module="mod_ssl"
    >SSLCipherSuite</directive>.</p>
</section>

<section id="sharedciphers"><title>Why do I get a 'no shared ciphers'
error when connecting to my newly installed server?</title>
<p>Either you have made a mistake with your
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLCipherSuite</directive>
    directive (compare it with the pre-configured example in
    <code>extra/httpd-ssl.conf</code>) or you chose to use DSA/DH
    algorithms instead of RSA when you generated your private key
    and ignored or overlooked the warnings. If you have chosen
    DSA/DH, then your server cannot communicate using RSA-based SSL
    ciphers (at least until you configure an additional RSA-based
    certificate/key pair). Modern browsers like NS or IE can only
    communicate over SSL using RSA ciphers. The result is the
    "no shared ciphers" error. To fix this, regenerate your server
    certificate/key pair, using the RSA algorithm.</p>
</section>

<section id="vhosts"><title>Why can't I use SSL with name-based/non-IP-based virtual hosts?</title>
<p>The reason is very technical, and a somewhat "chicken and egg" problem.
    The SSL protocol layer stays below the HTTP protocol layer and
    encapsulates HTTP. When an SSL connection (HTTPS) is established
    Apache/mod_ssl has to negotiate the SSL protocol parameters with the
    client. For this, mod_ssl has to consult the configuration of the virtual
    server (for instance it has to look for the cipher suite, the server
    certificate, etc.). But in order to go to the correct virtual server
    Apache has to know the <code>Host</code> HTTP header field. To do this, the
    HTTP request header has to be read. This cannot be done before the SSL
    handshake is finished, but the information is needed in order to
    complete the SSL handshake phase. See the next question for how to
    circumvent this issue.</p>

    <p>Note that if you have a wildcard SSL certificate, or a
    certificate that has multiple hostnames on it using subjectAltName
    fields, you can use SSL on name-based virtual hosts without further
    workarounds.</p>
</section>

<section id="vhosts2"><title>Is it possible to use Name-Based
Virtual Hosting to identify different SSL virtual hosts?</title>
    <p>Name-Based Virtual Hosting is a very popular method of identifying
    different virtual hosts. It allows you to use the same IP address and
    the same port number for many different sites. When people move on to
    SSL, it seems natural to assume that the same method can be used to have
    lots of different SSL virtual hosts on the same server.</p>

    <p>It is possible, but only if using a 2.2.12 or later web server,
    built with 0.9.8j or later OpenSSL.  This is because it requires a
    feature that only the most recent revisions of the SSL
    specification added, called Server Name Indication (SNI).</p>

    <p>Note that if you have a wildcard SSL certificate, or a
    certificate that has multiple hostnames on it using subjectAltName
    fields, you can use SSL on name-based virtual hosts without further
    workarounds.</p>

    <p>The reason is that the SSL protocol is a separate layer which
    encapsulates the HTTP protocol. So the SSL session is a separate
    transaction, that takes place before the HTTP session has begun.
    The server receives an SSL request on IP address X and port Y
    (usually 443). Since the SSL request did not contain any Host:
    field, the server had no way to decide which SSL virtual host to use.
    Usually, it just used the first one it found which matched the
    port and IP address specified.</p>

    <p>If you are using a version of the web server and OpenSSL that
    support SNI, though, and the client's browser also supports SNI,
    then the hostname is included in the original SSL request, and the
    web server can select the correct SSL virtual host.</p>

    <p>You can, of course, use Name-Based Virtual Hosting to identify many
    non-SSL virtual hosts (all on port 80, for example) and then
    have a single SSL virtual host (on port 443). But if you do this,
    you must make sure to put the non-SSL port number on the NameVirtualHost
    directive, e.g.</p>

    <highlight language="config">
      NameVirtualHost 192.168.1.1:80
    </highlight>

    <p>Other workaround solutions include: </p>

    <p>Using separate IP addresses for different SSL hosts.
    Using different port numbers for different SSL hosts.</p>
</section>

<section id="comp"><title>How do I get SSL compression working?</title>
<p>Although SSL compression negotiation was defined in the specification
of SSLv2 and TLS, it took until May 2004 for RFC 3749 to define DEFLATE as
a negotiable standard compression method.
</p>
<p>OpenSSL 0.9.8 started to support this by default when compiled with the
<code>zlib</code> option. If both the client and the server support compression,
it will be used. However, most clients still try to initially connect with an
SSLv2 Hello. As SSLv2 did not include an array of preferred compression algorithms
in its handshake, compression cannot be negotiated with these clients.
If the client disables support for SSLv2, either an SSLv3 or TLS Hello
may be sent, depending on which SSL library is used, and compression may
be set up. You can verify whether clients make use of SSL compression by
logging the <code>%{SSL_COMPRESS_METHOD}x</code> variable.
</p>

<section id="lockicon"><title>When I use Basic Authentication over HTTPS
the lock icon in Netscape browsers stays unlocked when the dialog pops up.
Does this mean the username/password is being sent unencrypted?</title>
<p>No, the username/password is transmitted encrypted. The icon in
    Netscape browsers is not actually synchronized with the SSL/TLS layer.
    It only toggles to the locked state when the first part of the actual
    webpage data is transferred, which may confuse people. The Basic
    Authentication facility is part of the HTTP layer, which is above
    the SSL/TLS layer in HTTPS. Before any HTTP data communication takes
    place in HTTPS, the SSL/TLS layer has already completed its handshake
    phase, and switched to encrypted communication. So don't be
    confused by this icon.</p>
</section>

<section id="msie"><title>Why do I get I/O errors when connecting via
HTTPS to an Apache+mod_ssl server with older versions of Microsoft Internet
Explorer (MSIE)?</title>
<p>The first reason is that the SSL implementation in some MSIE versions has
    some subtle bugs related to the HTTP keep-alive facility and the SSL close
    notify alerts on socket connection close. Additionally the interaction
    between SSL and HTTP/1.1 features are problematic in some MSIE versions.
    You can work around these problems by forcing Apache not to use HTTP/1.1,
    keep-alive connections or send the SSL close notify messages to MSIE clients.
    This can be done by using the following directive in your SSL-aware
    virtual host section:</p>
    <highlight language="config">
SetEnvIf User-Agent "MSIE [2-5]" \
         nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
         downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
    </highlight>
    <p>Further, some MSIE versions have problems with particular ciphers.
    Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement a MSIE-specific
    workaround for this, because the ciphers are needed as early as the
    SSL handshake phase. So a MSIE-specific
    <directive module="mod_setenvif">SetEnvIf</directive> won't solve these
    problems. Instead, you will have to make more drastic
    adjustments to the global parameters. Before you decide to do
    this, make sure your clients really have problems. If not, do not
    make these changes - they will affect <em>all</em> your clients, MSIE
    or otherwise.</p>
</section>

<section id="srp"><title>How do I enable TLS-SRP?</title>
    <p>TLS-SRP (Secure Remote Password key exchange for TLS, specified in RFC 5054)
    can supplement or replace certificates in authenticating an SSL connection.
    To use TLS-SRP, set the
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLSRPVerifierFile</directive> directive to
    point to an OpenSSL SRP verifier file. To create the verifier file, use the
    <code>openssl</code> tool:</p>
    <example>
    openssl srp -srpvfile passwd.srpv -add username
    </example>
    <p>After creating this file, specify it in the SSL server configuration:</p>
    <example>
    SSLSRPVerifierFile /path/to/passwd.srpv
    </example>
    <p>To force clients to use non-certificate TLS-SRP cipher suites, use the
    following directive:</p>
    <example>
    SSLCipherSuite "!DSS:!aRSA:SRP"
    </example>
</section>

<section id="javadh"><title>Why do I get handshake failures with Java-based clients when using a certificate with more than 1024 bits?</title>
    <p>Beginning with version 2.5.0-dev as of 2013-09-29,
    <module>mod_ssl</module> will use DH parameters which include primes
    with lengths of more than 1024 bits. Java 7 and earlier limit their
    support for DH prime sizes to a maximum of 1024 bits, however.</p>

    <p>If your Java-based client aborts with exceptions such as
    <code>java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not generate DH keypair</code> and
    <code>java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: Prime size must be
    multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 1024 (inclusive)</code>,
    and httpd logs <code>tlsv1 alert internal error (SSL alert number 80)</code>
    (at <directive module="core">LogLevel</directive> <code>info</code>
    or higher), you can either rearrange mod_ssl's cipher list with
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLCipherSuite</directive>
    (possibly in conjunction with <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLHonorCipherOrder</directive>),
    or you can use custom DH parameters with a 1024-bit prime, which
    will always have precedence over any of the built-in DH parameters.</p>

    <p>To generate custom DH parameters, use the <code>openssl dhparam 1024</code>
    command. Alternatively, you can use the following standard 1024-bit DH
    parameters from <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt">RFC 2409</a>,
    section 6.2:</p>
    <example><pre>-----BEGIN DH PARAMETERS-----
MIGHAoGBAP//////////yQ/aoiFowjTExmKLgNwc0SkCTgiKZ8x0Agu+pjsTmyJR
Sgh5jjQE3e+VGbPNOkMbMCsKbfJfFDdP4TVtbVHCReSFtXZiXn7G9ExC6aY37WsL
/1y29Aa37e44a/taiZ+lrp8kEXxLH+ZJKGZR7OZTgf//////////AgEC
-----END DH PARAMETERS-----</pre></example>
    <p>Add the custom parameters including the "BEGIN DH PARAMETERS" and
    "END DH PARAMETERS" lines to the end of the first certificate file
    you have configured using the
    <directive module="mod_ssl">SSLCertificateFile</directive> directive.</p>

</section>

<section id="reportdetails"><title>What information should I
provide when writing a bug report?</title>
<p>You should always provide at least the following information:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Apache httpd and OpenSSL version information</dt>
    <dd>The Apache version can be determined
        by running <code>httpd -v</code>. The OpenSSL version can be
        determined by running <code>openssl version</code>. Alternatively, if
        you have Lynx installed, you can run the command <code>lynx -mime_header
        http://localhost/ | grep Server</code> to gather this information in a
        single step.
    </dd>

    <dt>The details on how you built and installed Apache httpd and OpenSSL</dt>
    <dd>For this you can provide a logfile of your terminal session which shows
    the configuration and install steps. If this is not possible, you
    should at least provide the <program>configure</program> command line you used.
    </dd>

    <dt>In case of core dumps please include a Backtrace</dt>
    <dd>If your Apache httpd dumps its core, please attach
    a stack-frame ``backtrace'' (see <a href="#backtrace">below</a>
    for information on how to get this). This information is required
    in order to find a reason for your core dump.
    </dd>

    <dt>A detailed description of your problem</dt>
    <dd>Don't laugh, we really mean it! Many problem reports don't
    include a description of what the actual problem is. Without this,
    it's very difficult for anyone to help you. So, it's in your own
    interest (you want the problem be solved, don't you?) to include as
    much detail as possible, please. Of course, you should still include
    all the essentials above too.
    </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section id="coredumphelp"><title>I had a core dump, can you help me?</title>
<p>In general no, at least not unless you provide more details about the code
    location where Apache dumped core. What is usually always required in
    order to help you is a backtrace (see next question). Without this
    information it is mostly impossible to find the problem and help you in
    fixing it.</p>
</section>

<section id="backtrace"><title>How do I get a backtrace, to help find
the reason for my core dump?</title>
<p>Following are the steps you will need to complete, to get a backtrace:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure you have debugging symbols available, at least
        in Apache. On platforms where you use GCC/GDB, you will have to build
        Apache+mod_ssl with ``<code>OPTIM="-g -ggdb3"</code>'' to get this. On
        other platforms at least ``<code>OPTIM="-g"</code>'' is needed.
    </li>

    <li>Start the server and try to reproduce the core-dump. For this you may
        want to use a directive like ``<code>CoreDumpDirectory /tmp</code>'' to
        make sure that the core-dump file can be written. This should result
        in a <code>/tmp/core</code> or <code>/tmp/httpd.core</code> file. If you
        don't get one of these, try running your server under a non-root UID.
        Many modern kernels do not allow a process to dump core after it has
        done a <code>setuid()</code> (unless it does an <code>exec()</code>) for
        security reasons (there can be privileged information left over in
        memory). If necessary, you can run <code>/path/to/httpd -X</code>
        manually to force Apache to not fork.
    </li>

    <li>Analyze the core-dump. For this, run <code>gdb /path/to/httpd
        /tmp/httpd.core</code> or a similar command. In GDB, all you
        have to do then is to enter <code>bt</code>, and voila, you get the
        backtrace. For other debuggers consult your local debugger manual.
    </li>
    </ol>
