The MotorZ MPM aims to create a single MPM, that runs on all modern
Unix and Win32 platforms, by levering APR as much as possible.

The MoteZ MPM uses an APR Poll CB event system, with  timers being
built in.  When an event, either an I/O or Timer is ready to run, it
is pushed to any available thread in the current process. A simple
APR Thread pool is used.

MotorZ uses Prefork as the framework and Simple for the actual event
structure.
