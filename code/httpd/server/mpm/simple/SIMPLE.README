The Simple MPM aims to create a single MPM, that runs on all modern
Unix and Win32 platforms, by using APR as much as possible.

The Simple MPM core run loop revovles around a Poll CB event system, with 
timers being built in.  When an event, either an IO or Timer is ready to run, 
it is dispatched to any available threads in the current process.
