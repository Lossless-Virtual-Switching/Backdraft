/**
 * A Tub holds an object that may be uninitialized; it allows the allocation of
 * memory for objects to be separated from its construction and destruction.
 * When you initially create a Tub its object is uninitialized (and should not
 * be used). You can call #construct and #destroy to invoke the constructor and
 * destructor of the embedded object, and #get or #operator-> will return the
 * embedded object. The embedded object is automatically destroyed when the Tub
 * is destroyed (if it was ever constructed in the first place).
 *
 * Tubs are useful in situations like the following:
 * - You want to create an array of objects, but the objects need complex
 *   constructors with multiple arguments.
 * - You want to create a collection of objects, only some of which will be
 *   used, and you don't want to pay the cost of constructing objects that will
 *   never be used.
 * - You want automatic destruction of an object but don't want to
 *   heap-allocate the object (as with std::unique_ptr).
 * - You want a way to return failure from a method without using pointers,
 *   exceptions, or special values (e.g. -1). The Tub gives you a 'maybe'
 *   object; it may be empty if a failure occurred.
 * - You want a singleton, but don't want to deal with heap-allocating an
 *   object on first use and freeing it later. Instead, just declare your object
 *   in a tub and do:
 *      if (!tub) tub.construct();
 *  - You want optional arguments to a function, but don't want to use pointers
 *    (i.e. use the Tub's boolean to determine that an argument was passed,
 *    rather than checking arg != NULL).
 *
 * Tub is CopyConstructible if and only if ElementType is CopyConstructible,
 * and Tub is Assignable if and only if ElementType is Assignable.
 *
 * @tparam ElementType
 *      The type of the object to be stored within the Tub.
